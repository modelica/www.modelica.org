Modelica is a language for modeling of cyber-physical systems, supporting acausal connection of components governed by mathematical equations to facilitate modeling from first principles.
It provides object-oriented constructs that facilitate reuse of models, and can be used conveniently for modeling complex systems containing, e.g., mechanical, electrical, electronic, magnetic, hydraulic, thermal, control, electric power or process-oriented subcomponents.

## Learning the Modelica Language

The Modelica language has been designed to be readable and understandable by engineers or in general students with a mathematical background. 

The classic free online language guides are:

- [The Modelica 1.4 Tutorial](/documents/ModelicaTutorial14.pdf) by the Modelica Association
- [Modelica by Example](https://mbe.modelica.university/) by Michael Tiller

In addition to these language guides, a [collection of books](/publications/books/) provides further background material and exercises. 

A quick overview of the syntax elements are provided by the

- [Modelica Web Reference](https://webref.modelica.university/) from Michael Tiller.
- [Modelica Quick Reference](https://reference.wolfram.com/system-modeler/ModelicaQuickReference.html) from Wolfram.

When coding it is good to follow certain conventions. You may have a look at the [coding conventions](https://doc.modelica.org/Modelica%204.0.0/Resources/helpDymola/Modelica_UsersGuide_Conventions.html) from the Modelica Standard Library.

When modelling, a lot can be learned from existing models. Hence, it is a good idea to study the Modelica Standard Library. 

## Using the Modelica Language

In order to use the Modelica Language you need a [tool](/tools/) implementing the language - and to be more effective [libaries](/libraries/) of existing models.

When learning the language with a tool, please take into account that most tools offer additional training material.
