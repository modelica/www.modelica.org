![Modelica Language](/images/Modelica_Language.svg)

Modelica is a language for modeling of cyber-physical systems, supporting acausal connection of components governed by mathematical equations to facilitate modeling from first principles.
It provides object-oriented constructs that facilitate reuse of models, and can be used conveniently for modeling complex systems containing, e.g., mechanical, electrical, electronic, magnetic, hydraulic, thermal, control, electric power or process-oriented subcomponents.

## Learning the Modelica Language

We recommend learning the Modelica language through [books](/publications/books) or [tutorials](/publications/tutorials).

## Using the Modelica Language

In order to use the Modelica Language you need a [tool](/tools/) implementing the language - and to be more effective [libaries](/libraries/) of existing models.
