<h2 id="letter-from-the-board">Letter from the Board</h2>
<p>Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP interested,</p>

<p>at the Modelica Association Annual Meeting 2020 a new MA board was elected, 
as it is regularily done every two years. The new MA board is the same as in the 
previous two-years period with the following exceptions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Vice-Chairperson Peter Fritzson resigned. Peter was one of the founders of the 
Modelica Association and had this position from the beginning. 
<strong>Martin Sjölund</strong> from Linköping University was elected as new Vice-Chairperson.
Since many years, Martin has contributed to the design of the Modelica language 
and the OpenModelica environment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The MA project leader Thomas Beutlich and the deputy project leader Dietmar Winkler 
of the MA project <strong>Modelica Libraries</strong> resigned from their positions after several years
of extensive work on the Modelica Standard Library leading finally to the new major
<a href="https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaStandardLibrary/releases/tag/v4.0.0">MSL version 4.0.0</a>. 
These positions are currently vacant, because no one applied to them.
Until a new project leader is elected, the MA Chairperson (Martin Otter) is temporarily 
leading this project. <strong>If you are interested in one of these positions</strong>, please contact
Martin Otter.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The operations of the Modelica Association will most likely grow in 2021. Currently, 
there are plans that two new Modelica Association Projects will be established next year. 
More details will be given, when formal decisions have been made.</p>

<p>Note, you can follow the development of Modelica Association activities on 
<a href="https://github.com/modelica">github</a>,
in particular for the <a href="https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaSpecification">Modelica language - version 3.5</a>, 
and for <a href="https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard">FMI - version 3.0</a>.</p>

<p>Despite the worldwide Coronavirus pandemic, it was possible to organize
two Modelica Conferences in 2020, both as pure online conferences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The American Modelica Conference 2020
(<a href="https://www.modelica.org/events/modelica2020Americas/program-outline">Presentations</a> - click on “Watch video”
 or inspect on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBl0BLUrtXJovo-FdBu7e2A">Youtube</a>, 
 <a href="https://2020.american.conference.modelica.org/proceedings/papers/papers.html">Single papers and slides</a>,
 <a href="https://ep.liu.se/en/conference-issue.aspx?series=ecp&amp;issue=169">Proceedings at Linköping University Press</a>), and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Asian Modelica Conference 2020
(<a href="https://ep.liu.se/en/conference-issue.aspx?series=ecp&amp;issue=174">Proceedings at Linköping University Press</a>).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We are very happy that this worked out quite well, and we will try to improve
upcoming conferences, based on this experience, and hopefully improved
Web-tools.</p>

<p>In 2021, the <a href="https://2021.international.conference.modelica.org/">International Modelica Conference will take place in Linköping, Sweden
on Sept. 20-22</a>. The conference is planned as a 
hybrid event - so both presenters as well as participants can either join physically, or remotely. Depending on the situation of the
Coronavirus pandemic, the conference might also be changed to a pure online conference, if
this is necessary. Note, the <a href="https://2021.international.conference.modelica.org/call2021.html">call-for-papers page</a> is open and you are encouraged to
submit <strong>full scientific papers</strong> and/or <strong>extended abstracts for industrial user presentations</strong>.
Final deadline for the submissions is <strong>April 26, 2021</strong>.</p>

<p>If you have interesting news for the Modelica, FMI, SSP and DCP communities,
please follow the <a href="https://newsletter.modelica.org/submission-guidelines.html">submission guidelines</a>.
The deadline for articles for the next newsletter is Fr. April 16, 2021.</p>

<h4 id="updated-cross-check-rules">Updated Cross-Check-Rules</h4>

<p>The FMI Steering Committee has passed an <a href="https://github.com/modelica/fmi-cross-check/blob/master/FMI-CROSS-CHECK-RULES.md">updated version 4.1 on the FMI Cross-Check Rules</a>, which includes the following changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The FMI Steering Committee revised its decision to introduce fees for listing in the FMI Cross-Check tables: there will be no listing fees for Cross-Check results.</li>
  <li>The FMI Steering Committee decided to reduce the required proof for import results to the self-assessment passed/failed files. This will help reduce the space requirements for the Cross-Check repository without practically reducing the quality of the results. Existing result files for importers will be removed by the project factotum without further notice.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="online-fmu-checker">Online FMU Checker</h4>

<p>There is a prototype of a new online check of FMUs available, see <a href="https://fmi-standard.org/fmu-check/">fmi-standard.org/fmu-check/</a>.
FMU Check performs a static analysis of the FMU that validates the following aspects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>validity of the modelDescription.xml w.r.t. the XML schema</li>
  <li>uniqueness and validity of the variable names</li>
  <li>completeness and integrity of the Model Structure</li>
  <li>availability of the required start values</li>
  <li>combinations of causality and variability</li>
  <li>definition of units</li>
</ul>

<p>It does not check the following aspects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>validity of the binaries</li>
  <li>validity of the sources</li>
  <li>any non-standard files inside the FMU</li>
  <li>execution of the binaries / simulation of the FMU</li>
</ul>

<p>This new online FMU Check is based on FMPy, a Python library by Dassault Systèmes to validate and simulate FMUs that has a graphical user interface, compiles C code FMUs and generates CMake projects for debugging, see <a href="https://github.com/CATIA-Systems/FMPy">github.com/CATIA-Systems/FMPy</a>
The online FMU checker complements the checking of FMUs with FMPy or the <a href="https://github.com/modelica-tools/FMUComplianceChecker">FMU Compliance Checker</a>, a command line tool based on the FMI Library developed by Modelon AB to validate and execute FMUs.</p>

<h4 id="maintenance-release-fmi-202">Maintenance release FMI 2.0.2</h4>

<p>The FMI project is planning a maintenance release FMI 2.0.2 with bugfixes and introducing the /extra directory in FMI 2.0 (already there in SSP, and to come in FMI3.0).
The release process has started, voting in the FMI Steering Committee and Modelica Association has been initiated.
The release candidate is and the released version will be available <a href="https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard">here</a>, where also the changes are listed.</p>

<h4 id="fmi-30">FMI 3.0</h4>

<p>You can follow the development of FMI 3.0 on <a href="https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard">Github</a> and inspect the latest development version <a href="https://fmi-standard.org/docs/3.0-dev/">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="fmi-user-meeting-at-the-international-modelica-conference-2021">FMI User Meeting at the International Modelica Conference 2021</h4>

<p>At the <a href="https://2021.international.conference.modelica.org/">International Modelica Conference in Linköping, Sweden
on Sept. 20-22</a>, there will be an <a href="https://2021.international.conference.modelica.org/fmi-user-meeting.html">FMI user meeting</a>, as part of the Industrial User Presentations on the first day. If you are interested to give a presentation, please find more information in the <a href="https://2021.international.conference.modelica.org/call2021.html">Call for Industrial User Presentations</a>.</p>

<h2 id="report-from-american-modelica-conference-2020">Report from American Modelica Conference 2020</h2>
<p>The <strong>American Modelica Conference 2020</strong> was held in a virtual format from September 22-24, 2020 and was a distinct success as the first virtual Modelica conference.  Twenty two papers and fifteen user presentations were delivered at the conference on a variety of theoretical and applied topics, ranging from the Modelica language and tools to mechanical, power, thermofluid, and aerospace applications.  Mark Jennings from Ford and Chris Gearhart from the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) provided keynote addresses related to model-based development for automotive applications, and the virtual format also provided a venue to hold new “Birds-of-a-feather” sessions in which the conference attendees could participate in roundtable discussions about a variety of forward-looking topics relating to the Modelica language and FMI.  Six free online workshops on a variety of subjects related to Modelica were also provided on dates either immediately before or after the conference, and were uniformly well-attended.</p>

<p>Perhaps most significantly, the new virtual format provided a new means for the conference to connect with attendees across the globe.  While the majority of the 231 attendees were from the United States and Canada, many attendees from Sweden, Germany, and the UK, among other countries, also participated in the conference.  This global reach benefited all of the attendees and the discussion at the sessions due to the wider variety of perspectives and experiences that could be shared.  In addition, the collection of recorded materials for the virtual conference also made it possible to archive these presentations for the future, and all of the talks and presentations are now available on the North America Modelica Users’ Group <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBl0BLUrtXJovo-FdBu7e2A">YouTube page</a>, while the proceedings and presentation files are also available on the <a href="https://2020.american.conference.modelica.org/proceedings/papers/papers.html">persistent event site</a> from the link at modelica.org.</p>

<p>We are grateful for your participation in the conference, and look forward to seeing you at the next conference in 2022!</p>

The generated FMUs comply with version 2.0.1 of the specification and support the following advanced capabilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Capabilities common to model exchange and co-simulation
    <ul>
      <li>Save and reload model states</li>
      <li>Multiple instantiation</li>
      <li>32-/64-bit Windows/Linux binaries</li>
      <li>Source-code provided (unique C file)</li>
      <li>Documentation including ONNX graph</li>
      <li>Initialization via start values and/or inputs</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Variable-step co-simulation (for static neural networks)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This new tool represents a first step towards the deployment of highly portable lightweight but accurate representations of physical models&nbsp;—&nbsp;executable digital twins&nbsp;—&nbsp;on a wide variety of targets (e.g. IIoT, Edge Computing or Cloud platforms), to serve various kinds of simulation contexts and purposes.</p>

<p>More will come in the next Simcenter&nbsp;Amesim releases with the end of the <a href="https://itea3.org/project/emphysis.html">EMPHYSIS</a> European project from which <a href="https://www.sw.siemens.com/">Siemens Digital Industries Software</a> is a member, and with the future release of FMI 3.0 to which Siemens also actively contributes.</p>

<h2 id="aviation-systems-library">Aviation Systems Library</h2>
<p>The new Aviation Systems Library (ASL) offers models for the aerodynamic behavior of aircrafts like airplanes or multi-copters. It uses standard MSL physical connectors to allow the design of propulsion systems with other libraries like the Electrical Powertrains Library (EPTL) considering the effects of the flight mission on the performance. Being fully integrated into the MSL MultiBody environment, all potential of Modelica libraries can be utilized.
In this first release, two main topics are covered:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Longitudinal dynamics of airplanes (fixed-wing) for designing a propulsion system considering the flight mission</li>
  <li>Full dynamics of multi-copter drones (rotating-wing) including the control system for mission planning and design of the propulsion system
The two areas share common models like propulsion or landing gear systems.  Components of the electric drive are structured in a reasonable way to allow replacing by custom drive systems from other libraries:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="propulsion.png" alt="Propulsion System" title="Propulsion System" width="623px"></p>

<p>The aerodynamic forces of wings or propeller blades are calculated by table-based profile polar curves. Geometrical arrangement of the aerodynamic objects to model an aircraft is conducted in the Modelica MultiBody environment. A simple tire model allows take-off from ground and landing:</p>
