<h2 id="letter-from-the-board">Letter from the Board</h2>
<p>Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP interested,</p>

<p>the first Modelica Design Meeting was organized in Sept 1996 in Lund and one year later, the <a href="https://www.modelica.org/documents/Modelica1.pdf">Modelica language specification, version 1.0</a> was published. We are very happy that this initial design was largely improved over the years and that the Modelica language is widely used in industry and academia. On Oct. 1-2, 2019, the <strong>100th Modelica Design Meeting</strong> will take place in Lund. This event is celebrated by several activities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Sept. 30, 2019, 10:30 - 18:30, a (free) Symposium with invited speakers is organized that present future directions of system modeling and simulation. For an overview of this event, see <a href="symposium.html">this newsletter article</a>, and for more details, see the <a href="https://modelica.github.io/Symposium2019/">Symposium web page</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sept. 30, 2019, 19:30 - 22:30, a (free) buffet dinner takes place to relax and further discuss the symposium topics.  A Modelica History and Celebration Session will take place during the dinner.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Oct. 1-2, 2019, there are Modelica Association meetings in Lund, especially to coordinate the different standards of the Modelica Association:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Modelica Language (formerly called Modelica Design Meeting).</li>
      <li>FMI (Functional Mock-Up Interface)</li>
      <li>eFMI (FMI for embedded systems; currently under development)</li>
      <li>DCP (Distributed Co-Simulation Protocol), including plug-fest for DCP where tools supporting the DCP standard
are cross-checked with regards to DCP compatibility.</li>
      <li>SSP (System Structure and Parameterization)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, the Modelica Association plans to establish an <strong>Industrial Advisory Board</strong>. The goal is to get more feedback and input from industry and align standardization activities with their needs. The “entrance barrier” for participation in this board shall be lower than for full membership in the Modelica Association (for example, no Contributor License Agreement (CLA) required, which has been created for contributors to MA standards). Interested company representatives are welcome to join the Kick-off-Meeting on Oct. 1, 2019, 9:00-10:30 (select during event registration) and/or send an email to Modelica board <a href="mailto:board@modelica.org">board@modelica.org</a>.</p>

<p>For more details on the Modelica Association meetings see the <a href="https://modelica.github.io/Symposium2019/meetings.html">agenda and schedule</a>. Feel free to attend, but <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/jubilee-symposium-future-directions-of-system-modeling-and-simulation-registration-63187850562">registration</a> is required.</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="aims">AIMS</h4>
<p>This workshop focuses on the integrated application of formal methods and co-simulation technologies in the development of software for Cyber-Physical Systems.</p>

<p>Co-simulation is an advanced simulation technique that allows developers to generate a global simulation of a complex system by orchestrating and composing the concurrent simulation of individual components or aspects of the system. Formal methods link software specifications and program code to logic theories, providing developers with means to analyze program behaviors in a way that is demonstrably exhaustive.</p>

<p>The two technologies complement each other. Developers can create prototypes suitable to validate hypotheses embedded in formal models and formal properties to be analyzed of the software. This is fundamental to ensure that the right system is being developed. Using formal methods, developers can extend test results obtained with co-simulation runs, and ensure that the same results apply to all program states for all possible program inputs. This enables early detection of latent design anomalies.</p>

<h4 id="topics">TOPICS</h4>
<p>This workshop will give researchers and industrial practitioners a stage to demonstrate new methods and tools, present experience reports, discuss open challenges, and explore ideas for future development of frameworks integrating formal methods and co-simulation. Contributions are welcome on all aspects of system development, including specification, design, analysis, implementation and documentation of software for Cyber-Physical Systems.</p>

<p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Development of new co-simulation methods and tools</li>
  <li>Integration of formal methods technologies in co-simulation methods and tools</li>
  <li>Experience reports on using existing co-simulation methods and tools</li>
  <li>Emerging standards for co-simulation</li>
  <li>Modeling and analysis of safety properties of cyber-physical systems through co-simulation</li>
  <li>Modeling and analysis of human-machine interfaces in cyber-physical systems through co-simulation</li>
  <li>Modeling and analysis of security aspects of cyber-physical systems through co-simulation</li>
  <li>Co-simulation of the next-generation cyber-physical systems</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="mastersim-open-source-fmi-co-simulation-master-takes-next-development-step">MasterSim: Open-source FMI Co-Simulation Master takes next development step</h2>
<p>The co-simulation master tool <em>MasterSim</em> (<a href="https://bauklimatik-dresden.de/mastersim">bauklimatik-dresden.de/mastersim</a>) 
has reached a new important milestone - with key focus on standard compliance and ability to
run a larger number of cross-check FMUs.</p>

<p><em>MasterSim</em> is an open-source development that aims at creating a 
reference implementation, giving developers of master tools and FMI slaves a 
transparant implementation to check and optimize their own implementations. 
For that purpose several modern co-simulation coupling algorithms 
(Gauss-Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, Newton) are implemented, and FMI versions 1 and 2 are supported. The 
rollback-feature of the latter is being used for the iterative algorithms. As C/C++ implementation, 
it is implemented with performance in mind. The code is hosted on 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mastersim">sourceforge.net</a> which also includes the documentation (wiki-pages). 
The simulation engine is complemented by the equally free post-processing software <em><a href="https://bauklimatik-dresden.de/postproc">PostProc 2</a></em>, which features run-time live updates of simulation progress.</p>

<p><img src="screenshot_mastersim_06_with_postproc.png" alt="MasterSim with PostProc"></p>

<p>In the release 0.7, <em>MasterSim</em> can already handle quite a lot of reference FMUs from 
the cross-check repository on all three supported platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac), and also 
includes the capability of importing csv-files with predefined time series as input to slave 
variables. The simulator itself is a command-line tool that reads text files (project and 
data files) and writes results in csv-format text files as well, which makes it very suitable 
to be used in scripted environments (and optimization tools). In the upcoming releases the user 
interface will be extended to hold a graphical representation and include graphical routing,
and will exchange such systems/simulation scenarios via the SSP-standardized file formats.</p>

<h2 id="new-avl-model-connect-2019-r1-with-fmu-calibration-support">New AVL Model.CONNECT 2019 R1 with FMU calibration support</h2>
<p><img src="MC_KeyVisual.jpg" alt="MC visual"></p>

<p>Model.CONNECT is AVL’s co-simulation and integration platform with built-in interfaces to all
the FMI standards and the leading 3rd party simulation tools and user’s code. With its patented
technologies for co-simulation error elimination (NEPCE) and RT/nonRT model synchronization
(ACORTA), Model.CONNECT enables connection of simulation models with HiL and hardware
testing environments.
In the new release 2019 R1 due in early April, Model.CONNECT comes out with an integrated
FMU creation tool fmi.LAB which turns Simulink controls models into FMUs, exposing
thousands of scalar and tables via standard XCP bridge to the leading calibration tools such as
INCA, CANape, AVL Concerto etc. With this feature Model.CONNECT closes the gap in usage
of softECUs in a virtual calibration process</p>

<h4 id="new-fmi-capabilities-in-the-recently-released-simcenteramesim20191">New FMI capabilities in the recently released Simcenter&nbsp;Amesim&nbsp;2019.1</h4>

<p>The recently released <strong>Simcenter&nbsp;Amesim&nbsp;2019.1</strong> has brought new enhancements to the support 
of the FMI standard, both in terms of usability and advanced capabilities. As always, 
these improvements are dedicated to serving the needs of our industrial users. 
The most noticeable functionalities are listed hereafter:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Simcenter&nbsp;Amesim co-simulation FMUs now comply with master algorithms 
that perform polynomial extrapolation on slaves’ inputs</strong>, which provides speed-up on specific models within advanced co-simulation environments.</li>
  <li><strong>Models containing encrypted supercomponents can now be exported as FMUs</strong> 
to be safely shared with partners and used within third-party FMI compatible tools.</li>
  <li><strong>The virtual calibration of imported 2.0 FMUs is now possible</strong>, thanks to the management of <strong>FMI tunable parameters</strong> directly within the <strong>Simcenter&nbsp;Amesim</strong> GUI.</li>
  <li><strong>Simcenter&nbsp;Amesim</strong> real-time capable models can be exported as <strong>co-simulation FMUs specifically generated for <a href="https://xmod.fev.com/">FEV xMOD</a></strong> test benches, typically to address Hardware-in-the-Loop / Engine-in-the-Loop use cases.</li>
  <li><strong>Simcenter&nbsp;Amesim</strong> real-time capable models can also be exported as <strong>“source-code FMUs” usable on <a href="https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/automation/topic-areas/industrial-edge.html">Siemens SIMATIC Edge Computing platforms</a></strong>, to cover high-end <strong>Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT) applications</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="PLCSIMAdvanced_KeyVis.png" alt="Interfaces to Siemens PLCSIM Advanced for SimulationX"></p>

<p>The new Modelica Co-Simulation library <strong>PLCSIM Advanced Interfaces</strong> as part of the Modelica library <em>Generic Interfaces</em> for SimulationX allows for Co-Simulation between SimulationX and the Siemens software <em>PLCSIM Advanced</em>.
This enables you to run Software-in-the-Loop tests (SiL) of a controller simulated in <em>PLCSIM Advanced</em> by Siemens and the automation object simulated in SimulationX.
One of the advantages of SiL is that the test is based on fully virtualized system components
and can therefore be performed before the procurement and construction of the same. 
The Co-simulation partners work on a virtual time basis so that the simulation is no longer carried out in real time making the requirements for real-time capable models obsolete.
Simply connect your Modelica model with the corresponding Co-simulation interface elements and start your SiL test.</p>
