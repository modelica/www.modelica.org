<h4 id="invitation-from-local-organizers">Invitation from local organizers</h4>

<p><img src="ModelicaConference2023.png" alt="Conference Logo" title="Modelica Conference 2023" width="400px"></p>

<p>We, the local organizers of this year’s Modelica conference are looking forward welcoming you in Aachen. We managed to book <a href="https://dasliebig.de/">Das Liebig</a> as conference venue, a former industrial building, which was recently renovated and is now one of the most modern conference sites in Aachen.
With valuable input by the Modelica community, we did compile a diverse <a href="https://www.conftool.com/modelica2023/index.php?page=browseSessions">Conference Program</a>, which includes interactive Tutorials, Vendor Presentations, as well as scientific posters and sessions.</p>

<p>We are a total of three instutes organizing this conference.</p>

<h4 id="institute-for-energy-efficient-buildings-and-indoor-climate"><a href="https://www.ebc.eonerc.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~dmzz/E-ON-ERC-EBC/lidx/1/">Institute for Energy Efficient Buildings and Indoor Climate</a></h4>
<p>With more than sixty scientists, employees in technology and administration, and other student workers, the Institute for Energy Efficient Buildings and Indoor Climate has its research focus on the reduction of energy demand to create thermally comfortable interiors.</p>

<p>In addition to the main consideration of buildings, vehicle interiors are also investigated. The coupling of measures on the building exterior and system technology to increase the energy efficiency of buildings lies within the context of energetic district approaches with the linkage of thermal and electrical networks. For the development of decentralized energy supply concepts with integration of renewable energy sources, concepts of generation-, load-, and storage-management with intelligent communication between all components are devised.
The work of the institute is based on comprehensive test equipment and advanced simulation methods, as well as the coupling of simulation and real hardware using hardware-in-the-loop and FMI.
The institute developed and maintains the open-source Modelica libraries <a href="https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/AixLib">AixLib</a> and <a href="https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/BESMod">BESMod</a>, and uses Modelica as the central simulation method.</p>

<h4 id="institute-for-automation-of-complex-power-systems"><a href="https://www.acs.eonerc.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~dlkd/E-ON-ERC-ACS/lidx/1/">Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems</a></h4>
<p>The goal of ACS is to implement a multidisciplinary research approach able to capture the most recent advances in ICT to support the solution of the most advanced problems in the area of grid dynamics and automation.</p>

<p>In order to achieve this vision the research in ACS is organized around three main pillars:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Grid operations</li>
  <li>ICT for Energy</li>
  <li>Control and Automation
Thanks to a multidisciplinary team that works at the intersection of traditional power systems with advanced control and automation concepts and modern ICT solutions, the research at ACS can cover, in a unique way, the following scientific areas:</li>
  <li>Joint analysis and design of power grid and communication infrastructure in future grids</li>
  <li>Modern control architectures and protection techniques</li>
  <li>Electrical distribution and usage in home, neighborhood and urban energy systems</li>
  <li>Distributed measurements and monitoring</li>
  <li>Data driven solutions for energy systems</li>
  <li>Future Internet for energy systems</li>
  <li>Advanced computing for simulation applications</li>
  <li>Real time simulation and Hardware-in-the-Loop testing</li>
  <li>System software and computer architectures for parallel co-simulation of power and communication systems</li>
</ul>

<p>ACS constantly develops and expands an advanced testing facility, a research topic in itself, installed in the ACS laboratory with unique custom solutions for</p>
<ul>
  <li>real-time simulation of power grids,</li>
  <li>hardware in the loop testing,</li>
  <li>power hardware in the loop testing,</li>
  <li>mixed power, control and communication simulation.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="institute-of-energy-and-climate-research-iek---energy-systems-engineering-iek-10"><a href="https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/iek/iek-10">Institute of Energy and Climate Research (IEK) - Energy Systems Engineering (IEK-10)</a></h4>
<p>IEK-10 develops models and algorithms for the simulation, optimization and control of energy systems, which are characterized by a high spatial and temporal variability of energy supply and demand, an increasing degree of intersectoral dependencies as well as an increasing digitalization. The focus is on multi-physical energy grids, industrial energy systems, and buildings and districts. A major goal of the research is to provide scalable and faster-than-real-time capable methods and tools that enable energy-optimal, cost-efficient and safe design and operation of these future energy systems. For this purpose, physical-technical system descriptions are combined with machine learning methods and customized simulation and optimization methods are developed especially for multicore, cluster and high-performance computers, which enable the handling of large-scale problems. With the help of the Reallabor “Living Lab Energy Campus” as well as a “Hardware-in-the-loop” laboratory, these innovative solution approaches for future energy systems are tested and validated under almost realistic conditions.</p>

<p>FMI is one of the hot topics at the coming Modelica Conference!</p>

<h4 id="fmi-beginners-tutorial">FMI Beginners’ Tutorial</h4>

<p>There will an FMI beginners’ tutorial on Oct 9 presented by the FMI project on the first day of the conference. 
You can find more information <a href="https://www.conftool.com/modelica2023/index.php?page=browseSessions&amp;form_session=5">here</a>, where also the material and installation instructions will be provided.</p>

<h4 id="talk-on-layerd-standards-to-fmi">Talk on Layerd Standards to FMI</h4>

<p>Members of the FMI project will present the concept of layered standards to the FMI standard.</p>

<p>The FMI standard - just like any other standard - faces the challenge of balancing generality with enabling specific use cases. 
Including every domain or use case specific extension in the core standard would significantly increase its length, making it difficult to read and implement.
To allow for extensions of the core standard for specific use cases, the Modelica Association adopted the concept of layered standards, first in the SSP standard and later in FMI.</p>

<p>Layered standards to the FMI Standard can be defined by any organization, not just the FMI project.
The FMI project is currently working on the following layered standards.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-xcp">FMI-LS-XCP</a> - XCP support of FMUs</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-bus">FMI-LS-BUS</a> - simulation of network communication with FMI</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-struct">FMI-LS-STRUCT</a> - representation of regular maps with FMI 3.0 arrays and the structuring of parameters</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="fmi-user-meeting">FMI User Meeting</h4>

<p>The FMI user meeting will take place on Oct 10 as a separate <a href="https://www.conftool.com/modelica2023/index.php?page=browseSessions&amp;form_session=22">session</a>.
The FMI Project and other related Modelica Association Projects SSP and eFMI will present their status and outlook.
Additionally there will be two “industrial user presentations” and a Q&amp;A.</p>

<h4 id="fmi-design-meeting-on-oct-12th-open-to-the-public-on-the-day-after-the-conference">FMI Design Meeting on Oct 12th open to the public (on the day after the conference)</h4>

<p>If you are interested in a deeper exchange with the FMI project you are welcomce to join the FMI design meeting on Oct 12 (the day after the conference) as a guest. The meeting is scheduled 9:30 - 12:30 h, optionally discussions can continue after lunch until 15:00 h.
There you can get in touch with the FMI Project members, discuss ideas, provide feedback, requirements, and new use cases for the FMI.
If you plan to participate please write to <a href="mailto:contact@fmi-standard.org">contact@fmi-standard.org</a>.</p>

<h2 id="modelon">Modelon</h2>
<p>Modelon is proud to be a silver sponsor of the upcoming International Modelica Conference. This year’s conference is an in-person event taking place in Aachen, Germany on October 9-11, 2023.
The Modelica Conference brings together users, library developers, tool vendors, and language designers to discuss the latest findings and trends related to the family of Modelica standards. 
As contributions to the conference program, Modelon will host a tutorial session, a vendor presentation, present a couple of papers, and be available for your questions and to talk shop at our booth. And last but not least: we are hiring! Looking for a job? Come talk to us at our booth!</p>

<h4 id="tutorial-session-techno-economical-assessment-of-industrial-infrastructure--optimal-design-and-control-to-reach-net-zero">Tutorial Session: Techno-economical assessment of industrial infrastructure – optimal design and control to reach net-zero</h4>
<p>Dynamic optimization based on CasADi has been around for a number of years and the advantages of this dynamic trajectory-based optimization approach are well understood. However, it has always been quite inaccessible and hard to integrate into engineering design workflows. With Modelon Impact, we are introducing a fully integrated solution to enable this exciting and powerful technology.<br>
In this tutorial, we will showcase advanced workflows of Modelon Impact – Modelon’s cloud-based system simulation platform and enables the linking of Modelica with CasADi. Modelon Impact is an easy-to-use tool that provides the ability to not only find the optimal design of your system infrastructure but also deliver the optimal control of the individual components for minimal carbon emissions and cost. Participants will only require a laptop that has either Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge built on Chromium.</p>

<h4 id="vendor-session-meet-modelon-impact--a-cloud-platform-for-virtually-designing-simulating-and-analyzing-industrial-systems">Vendor Session: Meet Modelon Impact – a cloud platform for virtually designing, simulating, and analyzing industrial systems.</h4>
<p>What happens when you combine the power of cloud technology with powerful system modeling and simulation? The emergence of cutting-edge MBSE application possibilities for commercial utilization. In this session, we’ll walk through real-world examples of how Modelon Impact goes beyond the traditional use of Modelica-based system simulation tools. We’ll also discuss the most recent updates to Modelon’s Modelica libraries, Modelon Impact, as well as what users can expect from the platform and its libraries in the near future.</p>

<p>In particular, we’ll be discussing
<a href="https://docs.sciml.ai/ModelingToolkit/dev/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ModelingToolkit</code></a>, an <em>open
source</em> Julia package for building high-performance symbolic-numeric equation
based models.  We will also be discussing our new <a href="https://help.juliahub.com/juliasim/stable/?_gl=1*1yf078s*_ga*MTU5NjU5MDY5Mi4xNjkzNTcwMzY3*_ga_8FC7JQQLXX*MTY5NDgwNzIyNS4xNC4xLjE2OTQ4MDg5MjkuMC4wLjA.#Pre-Built-Model-Libraries">HVAC and Battery
libraries</a>
built on top of ModelingToolkit which will be available in our
forthcoming web-based modeling environment, JuliaSim.  Finally, we’ll be
discussing how our new <a href="https://help.juliahub.com/juliasimdigitalecho/stable/?_gl=1*6aga0j*_ga*MTU5NjU5MDY5Mi4xNjkzNTcwMzY3*_ga_8FC7JQQLXX*MTY5NDgwNzIyNS4xNC4xLjE2OTQ4MDkzMTYuMC4wLjA.">Digital Echo
methdology</a>
allows customers to transform their existing, physics-based models (including
FMUs) into surrogate models which are accurate to within a few percentage points
but run significantly faster.  The performance of these tools is described in
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05244">the following paper</a> which shows how an HVAC
model, running in the JuliaSim environment and leveraging our Digital Echo
surrogate technology, demonstrated a 590x speed-up over previous models.</p>

<p>We will be happy to answer questions about these technologies or any of our other technologies like our model calibration and optimization tools or our control system design and analysis capabilities.  We are looking forward to seeing you all at the International Modelica Conference 2023, in Aachen.</p>

<p><img src="TLK_Energy_Logo.jpg" alt="TLK Energy Logo" title="TLK Energy"></p>

<p>This year <a href="https://tlk-energy.de/">TLK Energy GmbH</a> is Silver Sponsor of the Modelica Conference in Aachen.<br>
Yann Pellny will give a presentation on “Balance of Plant Simulation for Electrolyzers”. He will present TLK’s work in collaboration with Neuman &amp; Esser on the highly topical issue of hydrogen production.
In general, the efficiency and power density of Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzers depend on several factors, such as the membrane itself, the liquid distribution, its design and the resulting heat and mass transfer.<br></p>

<p>To ensure safe and efficient operation under transient conditions, various parameters such as stack temperature and membrane moisture must be controlled.
This is referred to as “Balance of Plant”. Here, simulation offers an excellent tool to analyze the overall system and find the right control strategy.<br></p>

<p>Yann will present a simulation model, that uses two simulation libraries:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://tlk-energy.de/en/software/process-systems-library">PSL - Process Systems Library</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://tlk-energy.de/en/software/til-suite">TIL Suite with the Add-On Hydrogen Systems</a></li>
</ol>

<p>When? October 10, 2023, approx. 3:45pm - 4:15pm<br>
Where? Room Carbon</p>

<p>Visit us at the conference for a face-to-face meeting. We look forward to discussing your use cases and demonstrating our tools.</p>
