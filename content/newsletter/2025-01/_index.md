<h2 id="letter-from-the-board">Letter from the Board</h2>
<p>Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP, eFMI interested,</p>

<p>The new year starts with a new release of one of our standards: SSP2.0 has been released as Christmas present but if you have not taken notice yet, you may very well choose to enjoy it as an Easter egg:</p>

<p><a href="https://ssp-standard.org/news/2024-12-20-ssp-2-0-release/">ssp-standard.org/news/2024-12-20-ssp-2-0-release/</a></p>

<p>Whereas SSP (such as all our standards) has been carefully crafted to be generically applicable to a wide set of applications, one major driver for these efforts is the automotive industry. Hence, we welcome the increasing exchange and collaboration of the Modelica Association and <a href="https://www.asam.net/">ASAM</a> whose primary aim is the standardization for automotive developments.</p>

<p>Regarding another important industry sector, we are also very glad to welcome <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsQzL5I5Ok">Liebherr Aerospace Toulouse</a> as new organizational member of the Modelica Association. Having one of the most important aerospace companies joining us is a significant gain for our community.</p>

<p>Standards such SSP are by their nature quite abstract in their description and hence the Modelica Association will increase its effort in providing suitable demonstration and educational material. One opportunity for a first introduction will be our next <a href="https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/">International Modelica &amp; FMI Conference</a> September 8-10 in Lucerne Switzerland: Here you can both join beginner tutorials as well as experts talks on the recent developments.
Of course, we invite you all to also contribute to this conference:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/authors/">Scientific paper</a> deadline is <strong>April 17</strong></li>
  <li>Deadline for <a href="https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/call2025/">Industrial presentations and tutorials</a> is <strong>June 1</strong></li>
  <li>The exhibition space offers an attractive <a href="https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/callforsponsors25/">platform for our sponsors</a> as well as the vendor session.</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore we are proud to announce our keynote speakers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mishra Siddhartha, Professor and Deputy Head of the Seminar for Applied Mathematics at ETH Zürich</li>
  <li>Johan R Åkesson, Associate Director for Computational Engineering at Carrier, Former CTO Modelon AB</li>
</ul>

<p>While we mostly look forward to our upcoming events, I also want to personally reflect on the last events that I experienced myself.</p>

<p>I want to thank Daeoh Kang and Yongha Han from South Korea as well as their whole team for taking the initiative to organize the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzdFK4601Fs">Asian Modelica Conference 2024</a>. It was great to see so many applications of Modelica &amp; FMI taking place in Asia generally and Korea specifically. To further strengthen our ties with Asia, I am currently planning a visit to China this May and meet Modelicans and new users from academia and industry.</p>

<p>Another joyful event was the annual <a href="https://openmodelica.org/events/openmodelica-workshop/2025/">OpenModelica Workshop</a> in Linköping, Sweden. The progress in coverage and usability on the open-source tooling were remarkable and hence the discussions in the panel focused on future directions such as lowering the barrier of entry for new users and the integration of AI tools. These are not only topics relevant to OpenModelica but to the Modelica Association as a whole and hence will be part of our next Project Coordination meeting end of March.</p>

<h4 id="maintenance-releases-fmi-302-and-fmi-205-available">Maintenance releases FMI 3.0.2 and FMI 2.0.5 available</h4>

<p>Two maintenance releases FMI 2.0.5 and FMI 3.0.2 have been released end of 2024 with clarifications and bugfixes and no new features compared to FMI 2.0.4 and FMI 3.0.1 respectively. 
FMUs created according to FMI 3.0.2 are valid FMUs according to FMI 3.0 and FMI 3.0.1 and vice versa. The good news is, that FMI 2 and 3 are actively maintained, and no serious bugs have been found in the FMI 3.0 specification yet, even though FMI 3.0 features are more and more used!</p>

<p>All releases are available on the <a href="fmi-standard.org">FMI website</a>. For a detailed list of changes see the <a href="https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard/releases">releases page on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h4 id="layered-standards-pre-releases-by-the-fmi-project">Layered standards (pre-)releases by the FMI Project</h4>

<p>The FMI Project is proud to announce the progress in the definition of layered standards on top of the FMI standard! (Layered standards are extentions to the core FMI standard for special applications.)</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-xcp">FMI-LS-XCP</a> v1.0.0 released: This layered standard defines support for <a href="https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/mcd-1-xcp/">XCP</a> or “Universal Measurement and Calibration Protocol”, a network protocol defined by <a href="https://www.asam.net/">ASAM</a>. This is the first layered standard on top of the FMI Standard released by the FMI Project!</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-bus">FMI-LS-BUS</a> v1.0.0-rc.1 release candidate: This layered standard defines how to realize the simulation of network communication with FMI 3.0 means.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-struct">FMI-LS-STRUCT</a> v1.0.0-alpha.1 prerelease: Based on FMI 3.0, this layered standard defines how variables (especially parameters) of an FMU can be structured and grouped in a more flexible way than with the “structured naming convention” of the FMI Standard. The first version of this layered standard is focused on the definition of sampled maps.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another layered standard, <a href="https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-ref">FMI-LS-REF</a> is in an earlier development stage. It will allow for the inclusion of related files into an FMU. This includes parameter sets, reference stimuli and results, which can be used in additional experiments, as well as other relevant files to the FMU, like the model sources, requirements, or specifications.</p>

<h4 id="slides-and-recording-of-our-presentation-at-the-asam-conference-2024-available">Slides and recording of our presentation at the ASAM Conference 2024 available</h4>

<p><img src="FMI-LS-ASAM_small.png" alt="Presentation on Layered Standards at the ASAM Conference"></p>

<p>Representatives from the FMI Project presented “The Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI), Layered Standards and ASAM standards - Enabling Seamless SiL Simulation of V-ECUs” at the International ASAM Conference 2025 in Munich.
The three new layered standards mentioned in the paragraph above were used for simulating virtual ECUs with FMI 3.0 means. A demo from tool vendors Akkodis, Altair, AVL, Bosch, dSPACE, PMSF and SYNOPSYS  illustrates the interoperability of these layered standards.</p>

<p>The slides are available <a href="https://fmi-standard.org/assets/literature/FMI-LS-ASAM_2024.pdf">on the FMI website</a>, and the video is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzzKRa3jORs">on Youtube</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ssp-2-0-the-next-step-in-standardized-system-simulation">SSP 2.0: The Next Step in Standardized System Simulation</h2>
<p><img src="ssp_2-0.jpg" alt="SSP 2.0: The Next Step in Standardized System Simulation"></p>

<p>The Modelica Association has released <strong>SSP 2.0</strong>, marking a major milestone in the evolution of the <strong>System Structure &amp; Parameterization (SSP)</strong> standard. Building on SSP 1.0, the new version expands capabilities for exchanging composite system models and simulation architectures, supporting FMI 3.0, Modelica components, and abstract simulation architectures.</p>

<p>Key advancements include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Architecture Exchange</strong> – Enhanced support for collaborative model refinement</li>
  <li><strong>Advanced Co-Simulation</strong> – Improved robustness for complex system simulations incorporating FMI 3.0 features</li>
  <li><strong>Broader Component Support</strong> – Integration of Modelica-based components</li>
  <li><strong>Virtual ECUs</strong> – Seamless incorporation of FMI 3.0-based vECUs</li>
  <li><strong>Layered Standards &amp; Metadata</strong> – Strengthened interoperability and traceability</li>
  <li><strong>Next-Gen Digital Twins</strong> – Enabling multi-layered system modeling</li>
  <li><strong>AI &amp; Machine Learning</strong> – Optimized parameter calibration for smart applications</li>
</ul>

<p>With SSP 2.0, industries such as automotive, aerospace, energy, and manufacturing can push the boundaries of digital engineering, virtual prototyping, and AI-driven development.</p>

<h2 id="the-ssp-traceability-layered-standard">The SSP Traceability Layered Standard</h2>
<p>The demonstrated credibility of simulations to decision makers is one of the key challenges to make system simulation more widely accepted. 
This has been clearly shown e.g. by the ASSESS initiative of NAFEMS, see <a href="https://www.nafems.org/community/assess/themes/credibility/">ASSESS Credibility</a>.</p>

<p>This critical topic is addressed in the SSP Traceability layered standard by the Modelica Association with a new standard to be released within the first half of this year. 
The SSP Traceability standard  provides standardized Documentation and Meta Data along the entire Process. It does so by building a <strong>Chain of Trust</strong> for Confident Simulation-Based Decision Making. 
This is achieved by establishing a digital thread of simulation-based evidence linking simulation processes to product requirements and KPIs, which makes simulation results for product decisions verifiable.</p>

<p>SSP Traceability enables open, <strong>Flexible &amp; Scalable Credible Simulations</strong> by documenting the relevant simulation process aspects in a traceable, consistent and standardized format that companies 
can tailor and scale to their credibility needs</p>

<p>The standard provides <strong>Flexible and Standardized Metadata Exchange</strong> through the built-in Simulation Resource Meta Data (SRMD) format. That format ensures a well-structured, 
flexible and efficient way to collect and share simulation metadata across the development lifecycle.</p>

<p>In addition, the new standard facilitates <strong>Model Reuse and Continuous Improvement</strong>, because the well-documented SSP Traceability simulation resources facilitate 
the <em>reliable</em> reuse of existing simulations and models and the continuous improvement of simulation best practices, processes and resulting artefacts.</p>

<p>SSP Traceability thus builds a bridge between process-oriented Systems Engineering (SE) and accuracy-oriented System Modeling and Simulation. The Modelica Association will 
work with other organizations, such as the <a href="https://www.omg.org/">Object Management Group OMG</a> to improve the interoperability between Modelica Standards, and SE-standards 
in the next steps to improve tool interoperability even further. <a href="https://modelica.github.io/ssp-ls-traceability/master/">The current specification</a> is available online. 
Comments by interested parties can be supplied in the <a href="https://github.com/modelica/ssp-ls-traceability/issues">issue section of the github repository</a>. The Release of version 1.0 of SSP Traceability 
is planned for Q2 2025.</p>

<p><img src="XRG_Logo_2015_4c_400px_neu.jpg" alt="XRG Logo" title="XRG Logo"></p>

<p>XRG celebrates its <strong>20th anniversary</strong> this year. The company was founded to deliver premium thermal system simulations to industrial customers with - at that time being - the relatively new Modelica modelling language. Today, we see a broad acceptance of this technology and a simple equation holds: <strong>Energy simulation = Modelica simulation</strong>. If you like to learn about our milestones from 2005 until the present day, please refer to:</p>

<h4 id="modelica-library-announcements">Modelica Library Announcements</h4>

<p><strong>HumanComfort Library 2.19.0</strong> offers a more detailed calculation of surface temperatures due to direct solar irradiation. 
The new approach, which is only available for the coarse grid CFD models, determines which individual surfaces are actually exposed to short-wave irradiation entering through windows of the air-conditioned space. 
For this the current time-dependent sun position (zenith and azimuth) is taken into account. This general feature is also applied to use cases like automotive cabins when the grid model is used. While changes in average air temperatures will be low, local changes can be stronger.</p>

<p><img src="HumanComfortIrradiation.png" alt="HumanComfort 2.19.0 features" title="HumanComfort irradiation demo"></p>

<p>Moreover, the new incidence angle model in opaque surfaces computes angle dependent transmission coefficients for the material, which might improve accuracy of irradiation and surface temperatures.</p>

<p><strong>HVAC Library 3.4.0</strong> for HVAC system simulation comes with significant new features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Optionally, liquid systems can now be simulated with <strong>detailed hydraulic parameters</strong>. This paves the way to <strong>hydraulic balancing simulations</strong>. During the dynamic simulation the pump’s pressure curve matches the system curve at any time and imbalances in mass flow (and energy) distribution can be investigated throughout the network. The classic performance-oriented approach is still available and switching between both modes with minimal interaction becomes possible. First industrial use cases gave positive feedback on this new feature.</li>
  <li><strong>Overall weather data files</strong> can be imported with one click. This convenient mode starts with the popular <strong>Energy+ weather file format (.epw)</strong> which is automatically converted to hourly input files. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lDxUXLGxI4">Learn more …</a></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="HVACPressureMode.png" alt="HVAC Library 3.4.0 features" title="HVAC presssure mode demo"></p>

<p><strong>ClaRa+ Library 1.7.6</strong> for energy system simulation provides these new features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A fast and efficient model for <strong>water-hammer</strong> effects in fluid flow has been included. The 1D finite volume model for fluid flow in pipes is suitable to simulate water-hammer effects accounting for possible formation of vapour cavities.  Numerical oscillations due to finite volume discretization are damped by eigenvalue shifting​ and the speed of sound in the fluid is corrected for the wall properties. This feature was successfully validated with experimental data.</li>
  <li>A <strong>compressed gas storage tank</strong> suitable for surface or salt cavern storage.​ The model can be used to model pressurized storage tanks for gaseous media regarding transient heat conduction to the surrounding material.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="openscaling">OpenScaling</h4>

<p>This month, XRG has gratefully received the approval to participate in <a href="https://itea4.org/project/openscaling.html"><strong>ITEA4 OpenScaling</strong></a> project from Apr. 2025 to Dec. 2026. The project aims to further enhance “open standards and established modelling and simulation tools to better support large-scale systems and distributed controllers optimized to minimize energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions”.</p>

<h2 id="openmodelica-1-25-0">OpenModelica 1.25.0</h2>
<p>OpenModelica 1.25.0 will be released late March 2025. It will be regular early-spring release of OpenModelica.</p>

<p>Main highlights: OMEdit now supports <strong>hierarchical parameter editing</strong> in structured models, a <strong>Reload package</strong> feature, and an <strong>Open Class in text view</strong> feature.</p>

<h4 id="openmodelica-compiler-omc">OpenModelica Compiler (OMC)</h4>

<p>The new front end has been further improved with <a href="https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20milestone%3A1.25.0%20label%3ACOMP%2FOMC%2FFrontend%20state%3Aclosed%20-reason%3Anot-planned">15+ issues solved</a>.
<a href="https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/issues?q=is%3Aclosed%20is%3Aissue%20milestone%3A1.25.0%20label%3A%22COMP%2FBase%20Modelica%22%20">Two fixes</a> regarding the new experimental
<a href="https://openmodelica.org/doc/OpenModelicaUsersGuide/latest/basemodelica.html#flattening-models-to-basemodelica">Base Modelica flat output</a>.</p>

<p>Regarding backend work, <a href="https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/issues?q=state%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A1.25.0%20label%3A%22COMP%2FOMC%2FBackend%22%20-reason%3Anot-planned%20">5 issues</a> were fixed in the currently used
backend. Additionally, <a href="https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/issues?q=state%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A1.25.0%20label%3A%22COMP%2FOMC%2FNew%20Backend%22%20-reason%3Anot-planned">15 issues</a> were address in the new backend,
which is still under development and experimentally available with the <a href="https://openmodelica.org/doc/OpenModelicaUsersGuide/latest/omchelptext.html#omcflag-newbackend"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--newBackend</code></a> compiler flag.</p>

<p>Regarding the C runtime, <a href="https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20milestone%3A1.25.0%20label%3ACOMP%2FSimRT%2FC%20state%3Aclosed%20-reason%3Anot-planned%20">several issues</a> were addressed.</p>

<p>A new experimental feature, the Newton Diagnostics, was added to the C runtime. This feature can be activated by the simulation flag
<a href="https://openmodelica.org/doc/OpenModelicaUsersGuide/latest/simulationflags.html#simflag-lv"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-lv=LOG_NEWTON_DIAGNOSTICS</code></a>; this computes and displays a ranking of the most likely start attributes responsible for the
failure of Newton-Raphson iterations on nonlinear implicit systems during initialization. As such, it can be an invaluable tool for troubleshooting initialization failures due to convergence issues caused by badly
chosen start attributes. For more details see the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amc.2021.125991">paper</a> by F. Casella and B. Bachmann on this topic (here is an open-access <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12433">preprint</a> on ArXiv)
and the <a href="https://openmodelica.org/images/M_images/OpenModelicaWorkshop_2025/2025-02-03_Newton_Diagnostics.pdf">presentation</a> at the 2025 OpenModelica Workshop for more details. Please note that residual scaling
is still not implemented, so this feature is not yet fully operational when applied to systems of equations that are badly scaled due to the use of SI units.</p>

<h4 id="graphical-editor-omedit">Graphical Editor OMEdit</h4>

<p>OMEdit 1.25.0 provides several, long awaited-for features.</p>

<p>The first is hierarchical editing of model parameters <a href="https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/issues/2891">#2891</a>: you can now change parameters not only for top-level components, but also for its sub-components.
This feature is available by right-clicking over component icons and selecting Show Element; this can be done recursively to set parameters of sub-sub-components, etc..
Replaceable components and classes can be handled in the same way. Previously, this was only possible by switching to the textual input mode and by manually adding the corresponding nested modifiers and redeclare clauses
to the top-level component instances.</p>

<p>The Reload feature was implemented <a href="https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/issues/5664">#5664</a>: if you right-click on a top-level package, the whole package is unloaded from memory and reloaded from the file system,
<em>while preserving the status of the already opened sub-packages in the Library browser</em>. Previously, you had to first select Unload, then re-open the package,
and then navigate again through the sub-package hierarchy to reach the model(s) of your interest. This feature is very convenient when working with multiple Modelica tools in parallel,
or when editing some parts of a library with textual editors, because it allows to update the loaded package to the updated version on the file system with a single mouse click.</p>

<p>When browsing the code of a class in the textual view, it is now possible to open any class mentioned in the source code by just right-clicking on it and selecting Open Class,
or just by the ctrl-click shortcut <a href="https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/issues/8854">#8854</a>.</p>

<p>It is now possible to select a part of a model diagram by dragging a selection window, then copy and paste all the selected components either in the same model,
or into a new model <a href="https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/issues/12687">#12687</a>.</p>

<p>OMEdit now automatically adds the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">each</code> prefix when providing scalar parameter values to parameter arrays,
avoiding the common error of forgetting to add it manually <a href="https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/issues/13636">#13636</a>.</p>

<p>The new instance-based infrastructure of OMEdit is now fully mature and far superior to the old graphical editing mode from all points of view.
Hence, starting from version 1.25.0, support of the old graphical editing mode is dropped <a href="https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/issues/13257">#13257</a>.</p>

<p>Many OMEdit bugs were also fixed in this release. Overall, <a href="https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/issues?q=milestone%3A1.25.0%20state%3Aclosed%20label%3ACOMP%2FGUI%2FOMEdit%20-reason%3Anot-planned%20is%3Aissue%20">40+ issues</a> were addressed.</p>

<h4 id="fmi-export">FMI export</h4>

<p><a href="https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/issues?q=milestone%3A1.25.0%20label%3ACOMP%2FFMI%20state%3Aclosed%20-reason%3Anot-planned">Several issues</a> regarding FMI export were addressed.</p>

<p>A serious bug <a href="https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/issues/13582">#13582</a> affecting co-simulation FMUs using the CVODE stiff solver was identified.
It has been not yet fixed, but it should be fixed in the final 1.25.0 release, or in a patch 1.25.1 release.</p>

<h4 id="omsimulator">OMSimulator</h4>

<p>OMSimulator focused on improving Model Exchange simulations. We analyzed multiple Modelica libraries, including MSL4, and addressed key issues in event handling and ODE solver implementation.
These enhancements increased coverage from ~50% to ~95% across several libraries.
The results were <a href="https://openmodelica.org/images/M_images/OpenModelicaWorkshop_2025/2025-02-03_OMSimulator.pdf">presented</a> at the OpenModelica workshop in February 2025.
The latest stable release, OMSimulator 2.1.3, is available on GitHub or via pip <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pip install OMSimulator</code></p>

<h4 id="next-release">Next release</h4>

<p>The next release is planned to be released in autumn 2025. It should include further improvements to the GUI such as a restructured Simulation Setup dialog, faster editing of large models in OMEdit, etc.
Further improvements in FMI 2.0.x export are also planned.</p>

<h2 id="containerizing-ssp">Containerizing SSP</h2>
<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b4cc490-c437-4d93-b454-dffbcd152d90" alt="DC Motor variants"></p>

<p>SSP means <a href="https://ssp-standard.org/">System Structure and Parameterization</a>, a relatively new standard for storing simulation models, parameter sets, and documentation.
Containerizing an SSP file is the new thing around town.
By that I mean converting a system described with SSP to a free-standing Functional Mockup Unit (FMU), which is a great benefit for tools that do not support SSP (yet).</p>

<p>Dymola supports import of SSP and export of FMUs (big news, huh?). Would it be possible to extend Dymola with SSP containerization?</p>

<h4 id="simple-containerization">Simple containerization</h4>
<p>Actually, that is pretty trivial to do using existing functionality, because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">importSSP</code> returns the name of the Modelica model generated for the “root” system defined by the SSP.
So we can use that to export an FMU.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>m = importSSP("DC-Motor2023.ssp", silentSave=true);
translateModelFMU(m, false, "DC_Motor", "2", "cs", false, 1);
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="containerizing-a-parameterized-model">Containerizing a parameterized model</h4>
<p>The next natural step is to apply an additional parameter set to our model, and then export it as an FMU with modified parameters encapsulated in the FMU.
Here we make an experiment by increasing the inductance of the electrical machine, where the data is stored in a CSV file.
The command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">importSSV</code> takes a parameter file in SSV or CSV format, and a model to apply those parameters to.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>m_alt2 = importSSV("DC_Motor_Alt2.csv", m);
translateModelFMU(m_alt2, false, "DC_Motor_Alt", "2", "cs", false, 1);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In Modelica we use the common idiom of extending from the base model while appying modifed parameters in the extends-clause.</p>

<h4 id="running-a-comparison">Running a comparison</h4>
<p>To run the simulation we can import the two FMUs, drop them into a model (called Unnamed, this step is not shown) and simulate.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>importFMU("DC_Motor.fmu", true, false, false, "", fill("",0), "DC_Motor_fmu");
importFMU("DC_Motor_Alt.fmu", true, false, false, "", fill("",0), "DC_Motor_Alt_fmu");
simulateModel("Unnamed", resultFile="Unnamed");
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The result demonstrates that increasing the inductance from 1 mH to 5 mH softens the motor torque.</p>
