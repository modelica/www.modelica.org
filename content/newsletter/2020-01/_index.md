  <p><img src="tlk-dave-logo.png" alt="tlk-dave logo"></p>
</div>

<p>DaVE is a visualization and simulation environment that is suitable for both the post-processing and the online display of dynamic data. The current <strong>version 2.0</strong> includes new developments and improvements, of which a small selection shall be mentioned here:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Easy exchange of configurations: The “Pack Configuration” command creates a zip file that contains the configuration and the data files used. This ensures that all files are available when the configuration is exchanged. This also simplifies the backup of data.</li>
  <li>Executing mathematical operations: The new Data Connector “Calculation” offers the possibility to do simple mathematical operations (e.g. sum, differences, average values etc.). The results are then available as additional variables and can be used in the instruments.</li>
  <li>Extended StateChart instrument: The instrument “StateChart” has been extended by various functionalities. In addition to automatic isoline labeling, the “Multi-Edit” function has significantly reduced the time needed to configure point labels. Furthermore, a search filter for VLE media has been implemented and the selection of a standard medium has been added. In addition, various options for the visual enhancement of the instrument were implemented.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dymola-2021">Dymola 2021</h2>
<p>Dymola 2021 will be generally available in May 2020. There are several key improvements in simulation performance and robustness. It is also possible to create snapshots of the result while simulating and to control the output interval from the model. Parameter sweeping can now handle more than two parameters. Furthermore, there are improvements in simulation analysis and profiling.</p>

<p>The new ribbon-based user interface that was introduced in Dymola 2020x has been further refined; the model tabs have been moved to the top of the model window. The plotting capabilities have been generalized to allow a matrix of plots in each window, and to provide additional result documentation for each plot window. A Moving Average operator allows smoothing of signals.</p>

<h2 id="tlk-til-suite-new-version-3-8-0">TLK TIL Suite - New version 3.8.0</h2>

<div style="float: right">
  <p><img src="tlk-tilsuite-logo.png" alt="tlk-tilsuite logo"></p>
</div>

<p>The TIL Suite is a comprehensive Modelica library for stationary and transient simulations
of thermodynamic systems. The current <strong>version 3.8.0</strong> contains the following innovations and
improvements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Homotopy: The new version uses the Modelica Homotopy function in many TIL models. This
function converts simplified model equations into the actual physical equations before
the simulation starts, resulting in a very robust and stationary initialization. This
alternative initialization method allows fast calculation of many different steady-state
operating points within a parameter study. Furthermore, the homotopy initialization
allows the simulation start from a defined stationary state at given boundary conditions.</li>
  <li>TIL 3.8.0 HD: The new variant of TIL “TIL HD” was developed for the calculation of highly
dynamic simulations. The advantages are noticeable in case of strongly changing boundary
conditions, switch-off and changeover processes with zero mass flows, controller tests
and real-time simulation. With TIL HD the simulation of systems with changing modes of
operation (e.g. switching between air conditioning and heat pump operation) is possible
on the basis of a single FMU. Please contact us if you are interested.</li>
</ul>

<p>For version 3.9.0, which will be released in April 2020, we would like to present a selection
of the new features that will be featured in this release:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New capillary tube model: With the new capillary tube model, the component library gets
another representative from the area of valves. After only a few user inputs to parameterize
the model, it is possible to simulate refrigeration cycles of refrigerator systems.</li>
  <li>New Examples: The “TIL Examples” are extended by several systems. For example, there will
be a refrigerator system, which already contains the new capillary tube model, and a
hydrogen filling station system, which uses the new substance data model TILMedia.Hydrogen.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tlk-tilmedia-suite-new-version-3-8-0">TLK TILMedia Suite - New version 3.8.0</h2>

<div style="float: right">
  <p><img src="tlk-tilmedia-logo.png" alt="tlk-tilmedia logo"></p>
</div>

<p>The TILMedia Suite provides calculation methods that describe the thermophysical properties
of liquids, gases, real fluids with wet steam region and mixtures. These properties are
calculated very quickly and accurately based on our optimized mathematical methods. Thanks
to its many interfaces, TILMedia is available in various programs and languages (Dymola,
SimulationX, Excel, LabVIEW, MATLAB, Simulink, Python, C++ and others).</p>

<p>The TILMedia Suite is continuously developed and contains several hundred different media
models (R-134a, R-1234yf, CO2, humid air, water-glycol etc.) from different publications
and sources, among them: TLK-Thermo, REFPROP, VDI Wärmeatlas, VDI 4670, CoolProp and
NASA Glenn Coefficients.</p>

<p>The current <strong>version 3.8.0</strong> provides besides speed improvements in substance data calculation
also new features, of which a small selection shall be mentioned here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New substance data model for H2: The TILMedia Suite was extended by the VLEFluid model
TILMedia.Hydrogen. With this model, substance properties e.g. for liquefaction or at high
pressures (up to 1000bar) can be calculated according to scientific standards.</li>
  <li>Faster calculation of VLEFluid objects: The calculations of the partial density derivatives
in VLEFluid objects can be deactivated, which results in a significantly higher overall
calculation speed.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="modelon-blog-leverage-standardized-encryption-and-licensing-for-modelica-libraries">Modelon Blog - Leverage Standardized Encryption and Licensing for Modelica Libraries</h2>
<p><img src="modelon-semla.jpg" alt="semla"></p>

<h4 id="open-source-encryption-standard-designed-by-modelon">Open Source Encryption Standard Designed by Modelon</h4>
<p>SEMLA (Standardized Encryption of Modelica Libraries and Artifacts) is a system for distributing proprietary Modelica libraries which supports:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Encryption</li>
  <li>Licensing</li>
  <li>Secure decryption of encrypted Modelica libraries</li>
  <li>Platform independence
Libraries are bundled in the MLC (Modelica Library Container) format, which are zip files containing the encrypted libraries and a manifest.
SEMLA was designed by Modelon developers to be an open source encryption standard, which allows library vendors to protect the intellectual property contained within their Modelica libraries. SEMLA can also prevent libraries from being copied and re-used by other Modelica users unless authorized by the library vendor.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="semla-interface">SEMLA Interface</h4>
<p>The SEMLA protocol allows a library vendor to access licensed and encrypted Modelica libraries via an LVE (Library Vendor Executable) interface, using a secure communication channel. The LVE is controlled by the library vendor and allows the vendor to choose which licensing and encryption schemes, if any, will be implemented in the protocol.
The communication channel is secured with an SSH 1.1 connection. This connection allows the LVE to communicate with a single or multiple authenticated Modelica tools. The library vendor can also create different LVE interfaces for each of their customers, with different licensing and encryption parameters for each instance, if so desired.
The SEMLA system also includes source code for a platform-independent utility called packagetool. The packagetool utility can be used to scan the Modelica libraries, encrypt the contents and create the MLC.</p>

<h4 id="learn-more-about-the-semla-protocol">Learn More about the SEMLA Protocol</h4>
<p>The SEMLA protocol is an open source project. Modelon has documented detailed specifications for the protocol in Tool-Independent Licensing and Encryption of Modelica Libraries.</p>
