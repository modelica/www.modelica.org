<h2 id="modelica-conference-2021">Modelica Conference 2021</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://2021.international.conference.modelica.org/">14th International Modelica Conference</a> was a remote and free event this year. It was broadcast from the Concert and Congress hall in <strong>Linköping, Sweden, September 20-24, 2021</strong>. 
It has been organized by <a href="https://liu.se/">Linköping University</a> and <a href="https://www.ri.se/en">RISE</a>, in cooperation with the Modelica Association.</p>

<p><strong>The conference</strong> opening was live-streamed from Linköping Concert and Congress hall, where the event was originally planned to be held.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7248038/146614501-4658eab5-10bd-446b-89b5-862998c22186.jpg" alt="modelica2021-fig1a"></p>

<h4 id="welcome">Welcome</h4>

<p>We would have loved to welcome you in Linköping at the Concert and Congress hall, but unfortunately even after delaying the conference by 6 months, we have made the decision to move the conference online due to the pandemic. We decided to turn this into an opportunity,  by waiving registration fees so that more people would have the possibility to get involved in the community. We are grateful to our sponsors and the Modelica Association for making this possible. Another change we have made this year is to extend the conference over the whole week, and we dedicated half of each day to scientific papers and half to tutorials, vendor sessions and industrial user sessions.  Two half-days were dedicated to Industrial User Presentation Sessions, that are not part of the proceedings, but an opportunity for actual users to exchange their experience with the community.  This year we received a total of 81 submissions, all throughly reviewed by our program committee.</p>

<h4 id="facts">Facts</h4>

<h2 id="american-modelica-conference-2022">American Modelica Conference 2022</h2>
<p>We would like to announce the <a href="https://2022.american.conference.modelica.org/">American Modelica Conference 2022</a>, which will be a hybrid conference event and the first opportunity since the 2019 conference to meet your Modelica colleagues in person. The conference will take place at the University of Texas in Dallas at the Davidson-Gundy Alumni Center from October 26–28, 2022. It is organized by NAMUG, the North American Modelica Users Group, in cooperation with the Modelica Association. Join us in person in Dallas or from the comfort of your own home, as the ability to watch streamed talks from the conference virtually will be provided for a reduced virtual conference admission fee.</p>

<p>These conferences are the main event for users, library developers, tool vendors, and language designers to share their knowledge and learn about the latest scientific and industrial progress related to Modelica, FMI, SSP, eFMI and DCP. The program will cover modeling of complex physical and cyber-physical systems, as well as tools, for a wide range of research and industrial applications.</p>

<p>In addition to paper presentations, the conference features several Modelica tutorials for beginners and advanced users, as well as industrial user presentations, vendor sessions, and an exhibition. The previous American Modelica Conference in 2020 was fully online and saw a record number of registrations compared to in-person events, so this time we want to combine the ease of attendance by remote participants from other continents with the fun of a real, in person event with lively discussions in the breaks and an in-person conference dinner!</p>

<p>This conference will have one or several conference tracks with presentations of peer-reviewed papers as all Modelica conferences, as well as a track of industrial user-oriented presentations do not need to be accompanied by a full scientific paper. The abstracts of the presentations will also be peer-reviewed by the conference board. Please see the <a href="https://2022.american.conference.modelica.org/call2022.html">Call for Papers</a> for details about paper submissions, as well as the calls for industrial user presentations, tutorials, and vendor presentations. The submission deadlines are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>May 1, 2022: Submission of full papers for reviewed papers</li>
  <li>June 1, 2022: Submission of extended abstracts for presentation-only contributions and tutorials</li>
  <li>August 1, 2022: Notification of acceptance for papers and presentations</li>
  <li>September 1st, 2022: Submission of final papers and one-page abstracts</li>
  <li>September 5th, 2022: Submission of final presentations</li>
</ul>

<p>We are looking forward to seeing you in Dallas, TX.</p>

<h2 id="fmi-physical-terminals-between-simcenter-amesim-and-simcenter-flomaster">FMI Physical Terminals between Simcenter Amesim and Simcenter Flomaster</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.sw.siemens.com/">Siemens Digital Industries Software</a> is proud to announce the recent releases 
of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQpT35UQYA0">Simcenter Amesim 2021.2 and Simcenter Flomaster 2021.2</a>. 
These releases represent an important step towards more synergies between our system simulation solutions, in which the FMI standard plays an important role, as shown hereafter.</p>

<p>As an early adopter of the FMI standard, <a href="https://www.sw.siemens.com/">Siemens Digital Industries Software</a> has decided to offer its customers one of the most awaited features of the FMI 3.0 standard right away. 
Indeed, the <b>Ports and Icons</b> feature that was <a href="https://fmi-standard.org/news/2018/05/30/fmi-3-0-alpha-feature-list.html">announced</a> by the FMI Steering Committee in 2018 
has the advantage of being fully backwards compatible with the 2.0 version of the FMI standard. Therefore, and in the spirit of the “Stability” 
<a href="https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard.org/blob/master/assets/FMI_DevelopmentProcess_1.0.pdf">Guiding Principle</a> of the FMI standard development, it has been leveraged already to increase
the interoperability between Simcenter system simulation tools. As concrete major outcome, Simcenter Flomaster 2.0 FMUs can optionally be equipped with physical ports when imported 
into Simcenter Amesim, enabling direct connections with hydraulic or thermal-hydraulic components, which also ensures a build-in coherence between physical units.</p>

<p><img src="Amesim_Flomaster.png" alt=""></p>

<p>By being able to connect Simcenter Flomaster FMUs directly to their Simcenter Amesim fluid components, users can benefit from the rich capabilities of the low-level FMI standard 
interface <i>augmented</i> with an improved interoperability and usability within the Simcenter system simulation ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id="tlk-til-suite-h2-system-simulations-with-new-components">TLK TIL Suite : H2 system simulations with new components</h2>
<p><em>Models for various types of fuel cells and electrolyzers are being developed in TIL add-on library ‘Hydrogen Energy Systems’. Together with the additionally included balance-of-plant models - for humidifiers, water separators, valves, pipelines as well as various turbomachines - the library enables steady-state and dynamic system simulations all around the fuel cell.</em></p>

<p>At the heart of the simulation of a fuel cell system - based on our TIL add-on library ‘Hydrogen Energy Systems’ - is a flexible and easy-to-parameterize stack model.</p>

<p><img src="til-brennstoffzelle.png" alt="TIL Suite fuel cell">
<em>Fuel cell system diagram with stack model (center) anode (left) and cathode supply (right) and simple cooling (top)</em></p>

<p>Due to the numerically robust modeling of the component and system models, such a system can be efficiently simulated under both steady-state and dynamic operating conditions. Flexible base models for PEMFC and SOFC stacks are available in the TIL add-on. These contain basic, fundamental reaction equations of the electrochemical cells. Thanks to the TILMedia substance data library, chemical and electrochemical reactions in the fuel cell models can be balanced precisely and extremely quickly in terms of energy.</p>

<h2 id="business-simulation-library-v2-0-released">Business Simulation Library v2.0 Released</h2>
<p>The free Business Simulation Library (BSL) supports modeling &amp; simulation of dynamical systems in the social sciences, e.g., business, economics, and ecology using the System Dynamics metaphor. Unlike the well-known System Dynamics library, the BSL makes use of <em>acausal</em> connectors so that multiple flows will automatically add up when connected to a stock. Also, mass balance requirements will not be violated when making connections across subsystems in a model. The <em>potential</em> variable within an acausal connection is used to transmit the amount contained in a connected stock making diagrams less cluttered and modeling faster. See the <em>word of mouth</em> interaction between potential customers and customers in the model diagram below, which is an example that ships with the library.</p>

<p><img src="BSL-production-chain.png" alt="Alt text" title="production chain"></p>

<p>The new release, while fixing some errors with regard to platform compatibility, mainly adds high-level classes for agile modeling of dynamical systems using an impact diagram like framework: Domain experts simply need to provide estimates for <em>polarity</em>, <em>strength</em>, and an (optional) <em>delay time</em> to specify the impact of one variable upon another, where the strength of impact is specified as a proportionality factor or an  elasticity coefficient (see the release notes <a href="https://bsl-support.de/BusinessSimulation/BusinessSimulation.UsersGuide.ReleaseNotes.Version_2_0_0.html">here</a>).</p>

<p>The library was developed using Wolfram System Modeler and can be downloaded from its library store <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/system-modeler/libraries/business-simulation/">here</a> or it can be downloaded from the developer’s GitHub account <a href="https://github.com/bslMS/BusinessSimulation">here</a>.</p>
