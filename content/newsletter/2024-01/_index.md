<h4 id="about-the-conference">About the Conference</h4>
<p>As part of the conferences promoted by the <a href="https://modelica.org/association/">Modelica Association</a>, the <a href="https://modelica.org/events/american2024/">American Modelica Conference 2024</a> is the main event in North America for users, library developers, tool vendors and language designers to share their knowledge and learn about the latest scientific and industrial progress related to <a href="https://modelica.org/">Modelica</a>, <a href="https://fmi-standard.org/">FMI</a>, <a href="https://ssp-standard.org/">SSP</a>, <a href="http://efmi-standard.org/">eFMI</a> and <a href="https://dcp-standard.org/">DCP</a>.
The program will cover processes and tools for the modeling of complex physical and cyber-physical systems as applied to a wide range of research and industrial applications.</p>

<p>In addition to paper presentations, the conference features several Modelica tutorials for beginners and advanced users, as well as industrial user presentations, vendor sessions, and an exhibition.  The previous <a href="https://2022.american.conference.modelica.org/">American Modelica conference in 2022</a> was also streamed, giving many Modelicans in other continents the opportunity to watch presentations on the latest updates on Modelica-related research and innovation.  In this version of the conference, we want to combine the ease of attendance by remote participants from other continents with the stimulating environment of an in person event with lively discussions in the breaks and an in-person conference dinner!</p>

<p>Please note that <strong>full paper presentations are required to be in person</strong>, while industrial user presentations can be given remotely.</p>

<h2 id="thermodynamics-connector-library">Thermodynamics Connector library</h2>
<p>The Multiflash Media Connector library has been renamed to Thermodynamics
Connector library with the upcoming Dymola 2024x Refresh 1 release. The reason
for the change in name is the expanded functionality beyond the existing
interface to Multiflash external equilibrium solvers and fluid property data.</p>

<p>In addition to the Multiflash interface, the Thermodynamics Connector library
v1.2.0 now provides an interface to CAPE-OPEN compatible property packages. The
new interface supports the integration of external multi-phase, multi-component
phase equilibrium calculations from CAPE-OPEN supporting software into Modelica models.</p>

<p>The CAPE-OPEN standard enables CAPE (Computer-Aided Process Engineering)
applications to interoperate. CAPE-OPEN is developed and maintained by the
CO-LaN organization (<a href="https://www.colan.org">CAPE-OPEN Laboratories Network,
www.colan.org</a>). Dymola, with the Thermodynamics
Connector library, is the first PME (Process Modelling Environment) to implement
CAPE-OPEN’s COBIA middleware. COBIA is the platform independent replacement for
the legacy, COM-based CAPE-OPEN architecture.</p>

<h2 id="til-add-on-adsorption-modeling-basics">TIL Add-On Adsorption – Modeling Basics</h2>
<p>Adsorption processes are well established methods for gas separation and are becoming increasingly important for direct air capture of CO2 and air drying in battery production. These processes can be dynamically simulated using TIL Adsorption.</p>

<p>Summary of the technical details:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Adsorption equilibrium:</strong> Various isotherm models (e.g. Langmuir, Sips or Dubinin equations) are used to model the relationship between temperature, loading of the adsorbent and partial pressure of the adsorptive.</li>
  <li><strong>Adsorption kinetics:</strong> The adsorption kinetics are modelled within an adsorption cell consisting of a gas and an adsorbent cell.</li>
  <li><strong>Mass Transfer:</strong> The mass transfer between gas and adsorbent cell determines whether adsorption or desorption takes place. The adsorption mass flow rate between gas and adsorbent cells is calculated using the linear driving force approach.</li>
  <li><strong>Heat Transfer:</strong> The mixture of convective heat transfer and heat conduction between gas and adsorbent is modelled using an effective thermal resistance.</li>
  <li><strong>Calibration:</strong> Calibration of heat and mass transfer coefficients is crucial for accurate simulation.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://tlk-energy.de/en/software/til-suite/adsorption">TIL Adsorption</a> model library can be used to perform comprehensive plant simulations like <strong>temperature swing adsorption</strong>:</p>

<p>With no off-the-shelf tools available, Claytex have developed our own tools for regression testing when building model libraries. One of them, the RegressionTest tool, is designed to be used as an integral element of a library development cycle. The other is the MultiRun tool, which provides a way for the model developer to quickly regression test a smaller batch of experiments in an automated way. This blog post serves as a quick overview of the MultiRun tool.</p>
