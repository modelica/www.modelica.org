## Letter from the Board

Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP, eFMI interested,

As an eventful year draws to a close, this Advent newsletter is the perfect opportunity to look back at our flagship event:

### Past and Future Events for Our Community

We are delighted to have received so much positive feedback about the [16th International Modelica & FMI Conference](https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/) in Lucerne. The new format — with dedicated tracks for FMI and related standards as well as for industrial user presentations — proved very successful. Both tracks were well attended, giving the conference a noticeably different character: many participants told us that the event felt more methodologically oriented and encouraged them to engage in exchanges with attendees from different application domains who face similar challenges. This kind of dialogue is exactly what we aim for as a truly multi-domain community.

Our participants also showed remarkable enthusiasm and stamina. Discussions remained animated throughout the entire dinner boat cruise, the packed program triggered the occasional sprint from one lecture hall to the next, and yet most attendees stayed until the very end, with conversations continuing past the official program.

Selecting the awards was no easy task for the conference board: many excellent papers were submitted, and eight free libraries entered the competition. Please have a look at the [corresponding Modelica news item](https://modelica.org/news/2025-10-27-conferenceproceedingsandfreelibraries/). Many existing free libraries also received significant updates. The official [conference proceedings](https://doi.org/10.3384/ecp218) have been published as Linköping Electronic Conference Proceedings (as well as the [proceedings of the Asian Modelica Conference 2024](https://doi.org/10.3384/ecp217)). Many presentations can be found online via the [conference app](https://pretalx.com/16thmodelicafmiconference/schedule/). Selected recodings of the live presentations are currently being processed and will be published soon. 

Once again, I would like to thank our two outstanding [keynote speakers](https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/#keynotes) Mishra Siddhartha and Johan R Åkesson as well as all participants in the panel discussion. We are very grateful to have received support from our [sponsors](https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/#sponsors). Most of the credit, however, goes to our local organizer, Prof. Ulf Christian Müller, Ivo Steiner, and the entire team from [HSLU](https://www.hslu.ch/en/). Organizing a conference of this scale is a tremendous effort, and the Modelica Association is truly grateful to have been able to hold its conference in such a marvellous location.

Of course, there is always room for improvement, and we will carry these lessons forward to our upcoming events:

- September 21-22, 2026: [Asian Modelica & FMI Conference](https://modelica.org/events/) in Hangzhou, China
- October 12-14, 2026: [American Modelica & FMI Conference](https://modelica.org/events/) in Atlanta, USA
- September 20-22, 2027: [17th International Modelica & FMI Conference](https://modelica.org/events/) in Prague, Czech Republic

The respective websites will go live very soon. Beyond these major conferences, please also note the many smaller workshops and events. I would particularly like to highlight for 2026:

- February 2-4: [OpenModelica/MODProd Workshop](https://modprod.github.io/cfp/) in Linköping, Sweden
- May 5, 2026: Modelica in Process Engineering – Community Meetup 2026, Cologne, Germany
- June 15, 2026: [EOOLT Workshop](https://eoolt.org/2026/index.html) on Equation-Based Languages in Bielefeld, Germany
- September 22-23, 2026: [ThermoSim 2026](https://tlk-energy.de/blog-en/thermosim-modeling-simulation-thermal-systems) in Aachen, Germany

…and this list is certainly incomplete. I also encourage you to watch for events from our partner organizations, such as [ASAM](https://www.asam.net/standards/). For me, it is truly wonderful to see so many activities that keep our community vibrant and thriving.

### On Modelica & FMI in China (II)

As noted in the previous newsletter, the user base for Modelica standards in China is very large and is supported by local tools and dedicated teaching material. However, the Modelica Association itself has so far been underrepresented there, which means that many Modelica- and FMI-related efforts within China remain somewhat fragmented. We shall also ensure that progress achieved in Asia flows back into the international standards so that the entire world can benefit.

To address this, the Modelica Association is proud to have gained [Dr. Rui Gao](https://modelica.org/news/2025-09-05-newsecretaryoftheboard/) (CTO of Nanjing Yuansi SimTek) as our new Secretary of the Board. He is currently focusing on the upcoming Asian Modelica Conference at Beihang University in Hangzhou. Dr. Gao has assembled a large organizing committee that includes tool vendors, industry representatives, academia, and members from Japan and Korea. His work will immediately help strengthen the Asian branch of our community.

Dr. Gao succeeds [Dr. Michael Tiller](https://modelica.org/news/2025-09-05-newsecretaryoftheboard/), who served on the board for more than 20 years. The Modelica Association is deeply grateful for his long service and pleased that he will continue as a regular member and in the board of [NAMUG](https://namug.org/).


### New Deputy Leader for eFMI

In addition to the board, there are also changes regarding the organization  of the eFMI Project. We are happy to announce that Daeoh Kang (CEO of [iVH Co., Ltd.](https://www.ivh.co.kr/)) is the new deputy project leader of the [Modelica Association Project eFMI](https://www.efmi-standard.org/). We gladly welcome Daeoh and like to thank Hubertus Tummescheit, our former deputy project leader, for his contributions and wish him all the best with his new affiliations at [The REUSE Company](https://www.reusecompany.com/).

Daeoh is well familiar with eFMI and Modelica, promoting its application in industry, like he showed at the [eFMI tutorial](https://youtu.be/HobYT2BYTL0) at the last [International Modelica & FMI Conference](https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/), 2025. iVH offers eFMI training for Modelica users in Korea and has been the conference organizer of the last [Asian Modelica Conference](https://modelica.org/events/asian2024/), 2024. In the spirit of the Modelica Association to open itself for Asia, Daeoh is a perfect match to represent and promote eFMI in the eastern hemisphere.

With Daeoh becoming new deputy project leader, iVH is also stepping up from Advisory Board membership to become a Steering Committee member.

### Teaching Initiative

In Lucerne, I briefly announced that the Modelica Association intends to launch a Teaching Initiative. The response was immediate and very encouraging.  Clément Coïc has taken the lead and has already started publishing an insightful series of [introductory articles on social media](https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/7373084674463719424/). If you are not active on social media, do not worry since the articles will also be made available in a more traditional format.

Alberto Leva raised a very valuable point by preparing content specifically for the control-engineering community, and several experienced lecturers have pointed us to their existing teaching material. The next steps for the Modelica Association will therefore be to make this material more easily accessible and to provide guidance in a form that allows interested learners (of any age and background) to quickly find the resources most relevant to them.

The teaching initiative is still in its early stages. One of its goals is also to give teachers and professors a stronger voice within our association. If you have good material you would like to share or ideas of your own, please feel free to contact me or Clément.

I wish you all a Merry Christmas, a joyful holiday season, and a great start to 2026

Dirk Zimmer on December 04, 2025 \
*Chair of the Modelica Association*

### News from the FMI Project

![FMI](FMI.png)

#### 16th International Modelica _and FMI_ Conference Sept 8-10 2025 in Lucerne, Switzerland

This conference was the first Modelica Association Conference that had the "FMI" also in its title - and it was a great success!
We had FMI- as well as industrial user track over the whole conference. This attracted about 40% more participants than at the last conference - especially from industry and attendants with main interest in FMI.
Key take-aways:

- FMI is used by almost everyone who visited the conference. Both in "standard use cases" - and in in many new cool applications and domains! 
- FMI 3.0 is getting the "new normal" - besides the widespread usage of FMI 2.0, in the majority of FMI-related presentation FMI 3.0 with its new features is used - and with growing tool support this accelerates fastly currently
- The Layered Standard concept hit a very important need to innovate fast without making the core standards too complicated.
- The FMI Layered Standard for Network Communication (FMI-LS-BUS) ist very fastly adopted (see below)
- At an FMI Advisory Committee Meeting the day after the conference with more than 50 participants, the FMI Project exchanged feedback, requirements and new ideas with many industry partners.

All FMI-related papers, tutorials and industrial user presentations on the [Literature page](https://fmi-standard.org/literature/) of the FMI website.

#### FMI Design meeting in Berlin 

![FMI Design Meeting Berlin](FMI-Berlin.png 'FMI Design Meeting in Berlin, Dec 3/4 2025')

The FMI Project had a very productive FMI Design Meeting Berlin on Dec 3/4 2025. Good progress was made on

- extending the FMI Layered Standard for Network Communication (FMI-LS-BUS) from CAN (v1.0) to FlexRay, Ethernet and LIN, which will then cover the main automotive busses, and is open for extensions to other busses in many other fields such as automatisation, aerospace etc.
- the coming FMI Layered Standard for Structured Data (FMI-LS-STRUCT), for which we plan to enter beta stage soon.
- the coming FMI Layered Standard for reference (FMI-LS-REF), for which we will have an alpha version soon.
- enhancements of the FMI Standard w.r.t. to efficiency for large-scale, communication intensive simulations.

Many thanks to Dassault Systèmes and the local host Torsten Sommer for their hospitality! 

#### The FMI Layered Standard for Network Communication (FMI-LS-BUS) - growing tool support and extension for Flexray, Ethernet, LIN

![FMI-LS-BUS Roadmap](fmi-ls-bus-roadmap.svg 'FMI-LS-BUS Roadmap')

The year 2025 marks a significant advancement for the FMI Layered Standard for Network Communication (FMI-LS-BUS). With the release of version 1.0, a key milestone has been reached, laying the foundation for a standardized and flexible representation of networks in FMUs. In general the FMI-LS-BUS approach is suitable not only for the automotive industry but also for all domains, such as industrial automation, aerospace, and energy.

Version 1.0.0 offers, for the first time, full support for Physical Signal Abstraction and extends Network Abstraction to include the CAN, CAN FD, and CAN XL bus systems. This enables developers to model complex communication structures realistically and interoperably. This step is an important contribution to the unification of simulation standards and facilitates collaboration between different tools and platforms.

But that's not all: Throughout the year, further releases were published, continuously expanding the functionality of the FMI-LS-BUS. Version 1.1.0-Beta.2 introduced support for FlexRay, an essential bus for safety-critical applications. Shortly thereafter, version 1.2.0-Alpha.2 followed, which for the first time provides Ethernet support for the FMI-LS-BUS. In parallel, work on draft version 1.3.0 was completed, integrating the LIN bus – an important step for covering low-speed communication in distributed systems.

These developments clearly demonstrate that the FMI-LS-BUS is well on its way to establishing itself as a cross-industry standard. It offers a scalable solution for the growing demands on modeling communication systems in a wide variety of application areas.

## Conferences and user meetings

### Modelica in Process Engineering – Community Meetup 2026

In many fields, Modelica has become a proven and widely used modeling technology. For thermal and energy systems, it is already a major success. In process engineering, however, its use is still limited to isolated activities, despite strong technical foundations and no inherent barriers to broader adoption.

Over the years, several promising efforts appeared — academic prototypes, industrial pilots, small working groups. But they rarely connected with each other, and many initiatives faded before a real community could form. At the same time, established tools such as Aspen and gPROMS continue to dominate the PSE landscape.

At TLK Energy, we work with these challenges directly. With the Process Systems Library (PSL), we see how much potential Modelica has in this domain. But we are also convinced that progress will only happen if those working on similar ideas finally find each other. A stronger network is needed — not only for discussion, but for concrete collaborations and projects.

To help spark this connection, we are initiating the **Modelica in Process Engineering – Community Meetup 2026**.

**Date:** May 5, 2026  
**Location:** ANNO 1858, Cologne, Germany

**Format:**
- Short impulse talks and application reports  
- Open discussion rounds and exchange of experiences  
- Show & Tell contributions from participants  
- Informal networking from 17:00  
- Joint dinner in the *Brauerei Malzmühle* from 18:00

The event website will go online soon. To receive an update once registration opens, please sign up for the [TLK Energy newsletter](https://tlk-energy.de/en/newsletter).

We look forward to connecting the community and meeting many of you in Cologne.

### EOOLT 2026: 10th International Workshop on Equation-Based Object-Oriented Modeling Languages and Tools

**Hochschule Bielefeld, University of Applied Sciences, Bielefeld, Germany** \
**June 15, 2026**

#### First call for papers

Many engineers rely heavily on model-based design and control of complex cyber-physical systems. Of paramount importance is the ability to capture all central aspects of such systems in the models, including the physical behavior of the system components and the architecture description of its software and hardware. This calls for a special class of modelling languages: hybrid modeling languages based on equations that support both continuous-time and event-based aspects. Modelica, SysML, VHDL-AMS and Simulink/Simscape are prominent examples. Using such a language offers a number of advantages: models can be reused, integration can be tested in an early design phase, and simulation code can be generated for a number of different platforms.

The EOOLT workshop addresses the current state of the art of equation-based object-oriented (EOO) modeling languages and explores topics that aim to overcome limits of their expressiveness, correctness, and usefulness. Moreover, integration of and comparison with related approaches and languages, such as actor-oriented, synchronous, and domain specific languages, are of particular interest.

Contributions to this workshop focus on methodological aspects and describe new solutions for the design and use of equation-based languages. In addition to full contributions, shorter work-in-progress papers are welcome, offering an opportunity to discuss current approaches within the community.

Typical subjects of the EOOLT workshop range from language design via modeling aspects to simulation code:

* Design aspects of equation-based languages and their formal semantics
* Relation to other languages such as functional reactive programming (FRP) or synchronous languages
* Verification, type systems, and early static checking
* Discrete-event and hybrid system modeling
* Acausality / non-causality and its role in model reusability
* Multi-resolution / multi-scale modeling using EOO languages
* Model-driven development related to EOO languages
* Equation-based modeling in the frame of system engineering
* Reflection and meta-programming
* Environments for modeling, simulation and debugging
* Mathematical formalisms for simulation semantics
* Code generation for real-time systems, embedded system, multi-core platforms, and distributed systems
* Tools for analyzing or optimizing equation-based models

#### Important dates

* Paper submission deadline: March 27
* Author notification: April 27
* Camera-ready: May 22
* Workshop: June 15

#### Submission guidelines

Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit the following contributions:

* **Full length research papers**: up to 10 pages for consideration by the program committee. Papers are welcome that offer presentations and discussions of existing languages and tools, their capabilities and limitations; reports on practical experience; demonstrations of languages, tools, benchmarks, ideas, and concepts; positions related to relevant questions; and discussion topics.
* **Work-in-progress papers**: up to 4 pages for consideration by the program committee. Papers are welcome that offer presentations and discussions of work-in-progress and open problem statements that can be thoroughly discussed during the workshop.
All submissions must describe original research work, not previously published or submitted for publication elsewhere. The program committee will evaluate the papers' technical contributions, relevance, originality, correctness, and clarity.

## Education news

### Learn Modelica and FMI over your breaks

![Learn Modelica and FMI website logo](./Newsletter_LearnModelica%26FMI.png)

#### New initiative to teach progressively Modelica on LinkedIn

Since mid-September, [Clément Coïc](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clementcoic/) launched a LinkedIn newsletter: [Learn Modelica & FMI](https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/learn-modelica-fmi-7373084674463719424/).    
The idea is simple: we all have busy lives, so if one wants to learn new skills, it should be through **short**, **gradual**, **clear** and **regular** notes or videos that can be consumed during a daily break - like when drinking your morning cup of tea 🫖 or coffee ☕️.

Since then, a dozen of articles have been published explaining *Modeling and Simulation* best practices, as well as Modelica and FMI concepts, such as causality and acausality.

#### Also available on its own website

The LinkedIn newsletter has now also [its own website](https://dr-clementcoic.github.io/LearnModelicaFMI/)!    
This makes it easier to find all the content that has been posted and allows for slightly better text formatting.     
This website will also, in the near future, host the models developed for the newsletter.
Articles are still being posted on LinkedIn first, as it remains the best platform to spread the word and exchange ideas on the discussed topics.

Contributions are welcome!    
Just reach out to me.    
Clem
