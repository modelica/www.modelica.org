<p><img style="min-width: 400px; width: 30%; float: right" src="./amc_keynote.jpg" alt="Scott Bortoff's Keynote Speech"></p>

<p>The American Modelica Conference 2022 was held in Richardson, Texas in October.
This was our first in-person event since COVID and from all appearances,
attendees thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to get together and discuss their
work with Modelica. There were around 60 attendees for this year’s event
presenting on a wide range of topics. There were also 42 virtual attendees who joined via the live stream.  The conference proceedings are available online <a href="https://2022.american.conference.modelica.org/documents/NA_Modelica_2022_Proceedings.pdf" title="American Modelica Conference 2022 Proceedings">here</a>.</p>

<p>This year’s keynote talks were given by Dr. Dirk Zimmer from DLR and
Dr. Scott Bortoff from MERL. Special thanks to Scott Bortoff for filling in at
the last minute!</p>

<h4 id="tutorials">Tutorials</h4>

<p><img style="min-width: 400px; width: 30%; float: right" src="./amc_tutorial_thermofluidstream.jpg" alt="Best Paper Recipients"></p>

<p>Continuing one of the most cherished traditions of Modelica conferences, this in-person event provided a perfect opportunity to hold a total of <a href="https://2022.american.conference.modelica.org/Workshops.html">six tutorials</a>.</p>

<p>Of special mention, the tutorial from the DLR team on the <a href="https://github.com/DLR-SR/ThermofluidStream/tree/tutorial">ThermoFluidStream Library</a>, led by Dr. Dirk Zimmer and Niels Weber, attracted significant attention from conference attendees filling the classroom to capacity!</p>

<p>We would like to thank to all the teams that volunteered offering tutorials for their value contributions that ultimately help building the Modelica community in North America and hope they can continue to do it in future editions of the conference.</p>

<h4 id="special-thanks">Special Thanks</h4>

<p>Special thanks to this year’s Platinum Sponsor, Ricardo Software (now Realis
Simulation) as well as to our Gold Sponsors, Dassault Systèmes, Modelon,

<h2 id="announcing-dymola-2023x">Announcing Dymola 2023x</h2>
<p>We are pleased to announce that Dymola 2023x will be available in November 25, 2022. 
<img src="Dymola-2023x.png" alt="Dymola 2023x"></p>

<h4 id="model-editing">Model editing</h4>

<p>It is now possible to view (read-only) libraries and your own files in separate browsers. This makes the separation clear, and you can arrange the browsers around your Dymola window to fit your workflow. The traditional view is the initial default.</p>

<p>The handling of external resources associated with a model, such as, images in the documentation or data tables on file, has been improved. This means that when moving or copying a model the resources are copied to the same relative location.</p>

<h4 id="simulation">Simulation</h4>

<p>Commands that perform multiple simulation can change any parameter, lifting the earlier restriction that evaluated parameters cannot be changed. However, changing a structural parameter will of course add the overhead of translating the model.</p>

<h4 id="model-import-and-export">Model import and export</h4>

<p>Dymola 2023x is the first release to support the much-awaited FMI 3.0 file format that is expected to gain wide acceptance. New features of FMI 3 (arrays, ports and terminals, early return to handle events) will be supported in the near future.</p>

<p>SSP import supports Simulation Resource Meta Data (SRMD) stored in the SSP file. The meta data has been proposed to facilitate a credible simulation process with an adaptable format.</p>

<h2 id="spread-your-knowledge-with-fmu-based-engineering-webapps-for-everyone">Spread your knowledge with FMU based engineering webapps for everyone</h2>
<p>Simcenter Webapp Server is a web-based tool that enables you to create engineering webapps in your company. As a model owner it’s an easy and safe way to spread your knowledge because you can grant the usage of this model through a customized webapp to anyone you give access. There are numerous applications where this can be of high value. Think for example about your presales/sales colleagues throughout the world who need tools for proof the performance of your products in front of their customers.<br>
Since release 2022.1 it is possible to create engineering webapps from a Functional Model Unit (FMU) created with other authoring tools such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Other system simulation tools like <a href="https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/products/simcenter/flomaster.html">Simcenter Flomaster</a></li>
  <li>3D simulation tools, such as <a href="https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/products/simcenter/STAR-CCM.html">Simcenter Star-CCM+</a></li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/products/simulation-test/rom-builder.html">Simcenter ROM builder</a> that creates an FMU based on your model or experimental results</li>
  <li>All third-party tools that can create a tool independent co-simulation FMU according to the FMI 2.0 standard.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-value-of-knowledge-is-in-accessibility">The value of knowledge is in accessibility</h4>
<p>The time and knowledge you’ve invested in creating your models is of high value, not everybody can do the same and many important decisions rely on them. Many of your colleagues or other connections would be glad to leverage your expertise even if they’re not an engineer themselves. With Simcenter Webapp Server you can spread your knowledge and support them with easy and safe access, which means:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No tool installation for end-users, the engineering webapps are available within a web browser.</li>
  <li>You can make sure that everyone is using the right version of the webapp and the FMU at any time, no versioning headache anymore.</li>
  <li>It protects your IP. Since you centralize all simulations on a server there’s no direct access to model IP.</li>
  <li>You control the permissions and can manage user access at every moment.</li>
</ul>

<p>How to create an engineering webapp from my models? The Simcenter Webapp Server is an easy to deploy and easy to use tool, <a href="webapp_server_details.html">these few steps show how to create your engineering webapps</a>.</p>

<p>In 1988, Saab made history with the Gripen - the first multirole fighter aircraft developed in Sweden to take flight. Since its initial development, Saab has been tasked with making iterations of the Gripen, which are each more powerful and technologically advanced than before.</p>

<p>This case study explains how Saab worked with Modelon to incorporate MBSE and greatly enhance the Gripen without overextending its in-house resources. <a href="https://modelon.com/support/modernizing-fighter-aircraft-with-open-standard-technology/">Read the case study.</a></p>

<h2 id="multiflashmedia-connector-library">MultiflashMedia connector library</h2>
<p>The MultiflashMedia connector library was initially released with Dymola 2022x.
With Dymola 2023x, it has been updated to version 1.1.1. The library is an
interface to the external multi-component, multi-phase fluid property models and
solvers of the <a href="https://www.kbc.global/software/advanced-thermodynamics/">Multiflash software package by
KBC</a>.</p>

<p><img src="dassaultsystemes_multiflashmedia-connector.png" alt="dassaultsystemes_multiflashmedia-connector.png" title="The MultiflashMedia
Connector Library"></p>

<p>The library implements an object-oriented approach to the medium model. The
interface to Multiflash is provided in the form of the <em>Properties</em>-class. Its
instantiation in a Modelica component or system model is mirrored by a Modelica
External object. The external object handles the communication with the
Multiflash software. Among the supported flash calculation input
variable sets are <em>p,T,N-</em>, <em>p,h,N-</em>, <em>U,V,N-</em>, as well as fixed-phase <em>p,X,N-</em>
flashes. The library supports the thread-safe API features of the Multiflash
software and is suitable for simulation on multiple cores in Dymola.</p>

<p>The fluid configuration is file-based, using Multiflash Command File syntax and
file format. For Modelica models that require fluid properties for more than one
single mixture, the configuration of multiple mixtures with distinct components,
phases and models within a single command file is supported.</p>

<h2 id="testing-library-1-6-0">Testing Library 1.6.0</h2>
<p>The Testing library allows to create test models graphically and run them in Dymola.
All libraries developed by Dassault Systèmes are using it to test several hundreds of test models with thousands of test cases.</p>

<p><img src="Dassault_Testing.png" alt="Graphical test results"></p>

<p>The latest Testing version v1.6.0 is available with Dymola 2023x and it remarkably improved the creation of reference results.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>New file formats:</strong> In addition to the previously supported .sdf format users can now also record their references into .mat and .txt files (used my MSL’s CombiTimeTable).
Switching between formats is easy: Just change the extension in the path to the reference file and record new references. No model changes are needed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Clean results:</strong> The burden of manually deleting unwanted trajectories form the recorded reference has now been eliminated. Unnecessary trajectories are automatically removed, so no manual steps are needed anymore (in previous version one had to cleanup the files with the SDF Editor).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Trajectory filtering:</strong> Constant segments in recorded trajectories can be filtered. This can dramatically decrease the file size.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We encourage you to try out the latest version now, which is available with the standard Dymola license.
