<h2 id="letter-from-the-board">Letter from the Board</h2>
<p>Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP, eFMI interested,</p>

<p>As an eventful year draws to a close, this Advent newsletter is the perfect opportunity to look back at our flagship event:</p>

<h3 id="past-and-future-events-for-our-community">Past and Future Events for Our Community</h3>

<p>We are delighted to have received so much positive feedback about the <a href="https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/">16th International Modelica &amp; FMI Conference</a> in Lucerne. The new format — with dedicated tracks for FMI and related standards as well as for industrial user presentations — proved very successful. Both tracks were well attended, giving the conference a noticeably different character: many participants told us that the event felt more methodologically oriented and encouraged them to engage in exchanges with attendees from different application domains who face similar challenges. This kind of dialogue is exactly what we aim for as a truly multi-domain community.</p>

<p>Our participants also showed remarkable enthusiasm and stamina. Discussions remained animated throughout the entire dinner boat cruise, the packed program triggered the occasional sprint from one lecture hall to the next, and yet most attendees stayed until the very end, with conversations continuing past the official program.</p>

<p>Selecting the awards was no easy task for the conference board: many excellent papers were submitted, and eight free libraries entered the competition. Please have a look at the <a href="https://modelica.org/news/2025-10-27-conferenceproceedingsandfreelibraries/">corresponding Modelica news item</a>. Many existing free libraries also received significant updates. The official <a href="https://doi.org/10.3384/ecp218">conference proceedings</a> have been published as Linköping Electronic Conference Proceedings (as well as the <a href="https://doi.org/10.3384/ecp217">proceedings of the Asian Modelica Conference 2024</a>). Many presentations can be found online via the <a href="https://pretalx.com/16thmodelicafmiconference/schedule/">conference app</a>. Selected recodings of the live presentations are currently being processed and will be published soon.</p>

<p>Once again, I would like to thank our two outstanding <a href="https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/#keynotes">keynote speakers</a> Mishra Siddhartha and Johan R Åkesson as well as all participants in the panel discussion. We are very grateful to have received support from our <a href="https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/#sponsors">sponsors</a>. Most of the credit, however, goes to our local organizer, Prof. Ulf Christian Müller, Ivo Steiner, and the entire team from <a href="https://www.hslu.ch/en/">HSLU</a>. Organizing a conference of this scale is a tremendous effort, and the Modelica Association is truly grateful to have been able to hold its conference in such a marvellous location.</p>

<p>Of course, there is always room for improvement, and we will carry these lessons forward to our upcoming events:</p>

<ul>
  <li>September 21-22, 2026: <a href="https://modelica.org/events/">Asian Modelica &amp; FMI Conference</a> in Hangzhou, China</li>
  <li>October 12-14, 2026: <a href="https://modelica.org/events/">American Modelica &amp; FMI Conference</a> in Atlanta, USA</li>
  <li>September 20-22, 2027: <a href="https://modelica.org/events/">17th International Modelica &amp; FMI Conference</a> in Prague, Czech Republic</li>
</ul>

<p>The respective websites will go live very soon. Beyond these major conferences, please also note the many smaller workshops and events. I would particularly like to highlight for 2026:</p>

<ul>
  <li>February 2-4: <a href="https://modprod.github.io/cfp/">OpenModelica/MODProd Workshop</a> in Linköping, Sweden</li>
  <li>May 5, 2026: Modelica in Process Engineering – Community Meetup 2026, Cologne, Germany</li>
  <li>June 15, 2026: <a href="https://eoolt.org/2026/index.html">EOOLT Workshop</a> on Equation-Based Languages in Bielefeld, Germany</li>
  <li>September 22-23, 2026: <a href="https://tlk-energy.de/blog-en/thermosim-modeling-simulation-thermal-systems">ThermoSim 2026</a> in Aachen, Germany</li>
</ul>

<p>…and this list is certainly incomplete. I also encourage you to watch for events from our partner organizations, such as <a href="https://www.asam.net/standards/">ASAM</a>. For me, it is truly wonderful to see so many activities that keep our community vibrant and thriving.</p>

<h3 id="on-modelica--fmi-in-china-ii">On Modelica &amp; FMI in China (II)</h3>

<p>As noted in the previous newsletter, the user base for Modelica standards in China is very large and is supported by local tools and dedicated teaching material. However, the Modelica Association itself has so far been underrepresented there, which means that many Modelica- and FMI-related efforts within China remain somewhat fragmented. We shall also ensure that progress achieved in Asia flows back into the international standards so that the entire world can benefit.</p>

<p>To address this, the Modelica Association is proud to have gained <a href="https://modelica.org/news/2025-09-05-newsecretaryoftheboard/">Dr. Rui Gao</a> (CTO of Nanjing Yuansi SimTek) as our new Secretary of the Board. He is currently focusing on the upcoming Asian Modelica Conference at Beihang University in Hangzhou. Dr. Gao has assembled a large organizing committee that includes tool vendors, industry representatives, academia, and members from Japan and Korea. His work will immediately help strengthen the Asian branch of our community.</p>

<p>Dr. Gao succeeds <a href="https://modelica.org/news/2025-09-05-newsecretaryoftheboard/">Dr. Michael Tiller</a>, who served on the board for more than 20 years. The Modelica Association is deeply grateful for his long service and pleased that he will continue as a regular member and in the board of <a href="https://namug.org/">NAMUG</a>.</p>

<h3 id="new-deputy-leader-for-efmi">New Deputy Leader for eFMI</h3>

<p>In addition to the board, there are also changes regarding the organization  of the eFMI Project. We are happy to announce that Daeoh Kang (CEO of <a href="https://www.ivh.co.kr/">iVH Co., Ltd.</a>) is the new deputy project leader of the <a href="https://www.efmi-standard.org/">Modelica Association Project eFMI</a>. We gladly welcome Daeoh and like to thank Hubertus Tummescheit, our former deputy project leader, for his contributions and wish him all the best with his new affiliations at <a href="https://www.reusecompany.com/">The REUSE Company</a>.</p>

<p>Daeoh is well familiar with eFMI and Modelica, promoting its application in industry, like he showed at the <a href="https://youtu.be/HobYT2BYTL0">eFMI tutorial</a> at the last <a href="https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/">International Modelica &amp; FMI Conference</a>, 2025. iVH offers eFMI training for Modelica users in Korea and has been the conference organizer of the last <a href="https://modelica.org/events/asian2024/">Asian Modelica Conference</a>, 2024. In the spirit of the Modelica Association to open itself for Asia, Daeoh is a perfect match to represent and promote eFMI in the eastern hemisphere.</p>

<p>With Daeoh becoming new deputy project leader, iVH is also stepping up from Advisory Board membership to become a Steering Committee member.</p>

<h3 id="teaching-initiative">Teaching Initiative</h3>

<p>In Lucerne, I briefly announced that the Modelica Association intends to launch a Teaching Initiative. The response was immediate and very encouraging.  Clément Coïc has taken the lead and has already started publishing an insightful series of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/7373084674463719424/">introductory articles on social media</a>. If you are not active on social media, do not worry since the articles will also be made available in a more traditional format.</p>

<p>Alberto Leva raised a very valuable point by preparing content specifically for the control-engineering community, and several experienced lecturers have pointed us to their existing teaching material. The next steps for the Modelica Association will therefore be to make this material more easily accessible and to provide guidance in a form that allows interested learners (of any age and background) to quickly find the resources most relevant to them.</p>

<p>The teaching initiative is still in its early stages. One of its goals is also to give teachers and professors a stronger voice within our association. If you have good material you would like to share or ideas of your own, please feel free to contact me or Clément.</p>

<p>I wish you all a Merry Christmas, a joyful holiday season, and a great start to 2026</p>

<h5 id="16th-international-modelica-and-fmi-conference-sept-8-10-2025-in-lucerne-switzerland">16th International Modelica <em>and FMI</em> Conference Sept 8-10 2025 in Lucerne, Switzerland</h5>

<p>This conference was the first Modelica Association Conference that had the “FMI” also in its title - and it was a great success!
We had FMI- as well as industrial user track over the whole conference. This attracted about 40% more participants than at the last conference - especially from industry and attendants with main interest in FMI.
Key take-aways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>FMI is used by almost everyone who visited the conference. Both in “standard use cases” - and in in many new cool applications and domains!</li>
  <li>FMI 3.0 is getting the “new normal” - besides the widespread usage of FMI 2.0, in the majority of FMI-related presentation FMI 3.0 with its new features is used - and with growing tool support this accelerates fastly currently</li>
  <li>The Layered Standard concept hit a very important need to innovate fast without making the core standards too complicated.</li>
  <li>The FMI Layered Standard for Network Communication (FMI-LS-BUS) ist very fastly adopted (see below)</li>
  <li>At an FMI Advisory Committee Meeting the day after the conference with more than 50 participants, the FMI Project exchanged feedback, requirements and new ideas with many industry partners.</li>
</ul>

<p>All FMI-related papers, tutorials and industrial user presentations on the <a href="https://fmi-standard.org/literature/">Literature page</a> of the FMI website.</p>

<p><img src="FMI-Berlin.png" alt="FMI Design Meeting Berlin" title="FMI Design Meeting in Berlin, Dec 3/4 2025"></p>

<p>The FMI Project had a very productive FMI Design Meeting Berlin on Dec 3/4 2025. Good progress was made on</p>

<ul>
  <li>extending the FMI Layered Standard for Network Communication (FMI-LS-BUS) from CAN (v1.0) to FlexRay, Ethernet and LIN, which will then cover the main automotive busses, and is open for extensions to other busses in many other fields such as automatisation, aerospace etc.</li>
  <li>the coming FMI Layered Standard for Structured Data (FMI-LS-STRUCT), for which we plan to enter beta stage soon.</li>
  <li>the coming FMI Layered Standard for reference (FMI-LS-REF), for which we will have an alpha version soon.</li>
  <li>enhancements of the FMI Standard w.r.t. to efficiency for large-scale, communication intensive simulations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many thanks to Dassault Systèmes and the local host Torsten Sommer for their hospitality!</p>

<h4 id="the-fmi-layered-standard-for-network-communication-fmi-ls-bus---growing-tool-support-and-extension-for-flexray-ethernet-lin">The FMI Layered Standard for Network Communication (FMI-LS-BUS) - growing tool support and extension for Flexray, Ethernet, LIN</h4>

<p><img src="fmi-ls-bus-roadmap.svg" alt="FMI-LS-BUS Roadmap" title="FMI-LS-BUS Roadmap"></p>

<p>The year 2025 marks a significant advancement for the FMI Layered Standard for Network Communication (FMI-LS-BUS). With the release of version 1.0, a key milestone has been reached, laying the foundation for a standardized and flexible representation of networks in FMUs. In general the FMI-LS-BUS approach is suitable not only for the automotive industry but also for all domains, such as industrial automation, aerospace, and energy.</p>

<p>Version 1.0.0 offers, for the first time, full support for Physical Signal Abstraction and extends Network Abstraction to include the CAN, CAN FD, and CAN XL bus systems. This enables developers to model complex communication structures realistically and interoperably. This step is an important contribution to the unification of simulation standards and facilitates collaboration between different tools and platforms.</p>

<p>But that’s not all: Throughout the year, further releases were published, continuously expanding the functionality of the FMI-LS-BUS. Version 1.1.0-Beta.2 introduced support for FlexRay, an essential bus for safety-critical applications. Shortly thereafter, version 1.2.0-Alpha.2 followed, which for the first time provides Ethernet support for the FMI-LS-BUS. In parallel, work on draft version 1.3.0 was completed, integrating the LIN bus – an important step for covering low-speed communication in distributed systems.</p>

<p>These developments clearly demonstrate that the FMI-LS-BUS is well on its way to establishing itself as a cross-industry standard. It offers a scalable solution for the growing demands on modeling communication systems in a wide variety of application areas.</p>

<h2 id="modelica-in-process-engineering-community-meetup-2026">Modelica in Process Engineering – Community Meetup 2026</h2>
<p>In many fields, Modelica has become a proven and widely used modeling technology. For thermal and energy systems, it is already a major success. In process engineering, however, its use is still limited to isolated activities, despite strong technical foundations and no inherent barriers to broader adoption.</p>

<p>Over the years, several promising efforts appeared — academic prototypes, industrial pilots, small working groups. But they rarely connected with each other, and many initiatives faded before a real community could form. At the same time, established tools such as Aspen and gPROMS continue to dominate the PSE landscape.</p>

<p>At TLK Energy, we work with these challenges directly. With the Process Systems Library (PSL), we see how much potential Modelica has in this domain. But we are also convinced that progress will only happen if those working on similar ideas finally find each other. A stronger network is needed — not only for discussion, but for concrete collaborations and projects.</p>

<p>To help spark this connection, we are initiating the <strong>Modelica in Process Engineering – Community Meetup 2026</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> May 5, 2026<br>
<strong>Location:</strong> ANNO 1858, Cologne, Germany</p>

<p><strong>Format:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Short impulse talks and application reports</li>
  <li>Open discussion rounds and exchange of experiences</li>
  <li>Show &amp; Tell contributions from participants</li>
  <li>Informal networking from 17:00</li>
  <li>Joint dinner in the <em>Brauerei Malzmühle</em> from 18:00</li>
</ul>

<p>The event website will go online soon. To receive an update once registration opens, please sign up for the <a href="https://tlk-energy.de/en/newsletter">TLK Energy newsletter</a>.</p>

<p>We look forward to connecting the community and meeting many of you in Cologne.</p>

<h2 id="eoolt-2026-10th-international-workshop-on-equation-based-object-oriented-modeling-languages-and-tools">EOOLT 2026: 10th International Workshop on Equation-Based Object-Oriented Modeling Languages and Tools</h2>
<p><strong>Hochschule Bielefeld, University of Applied Sciences, Bielefeld, Germany</strong> <br>
<strong>June 15, 2026</strong></p>

<h4 id="first-call-for-papers">First call for papers</h4>

<p>Many engineers rely heavily on model-based design and control of complex cyber-physical systems. Of paramount importance is the ability to capture all central aspects of such systems in the models, including the physical behavior of the system components and the architecture description of its software and hardware. This calls for a special class of modelling languages: hybrid modeling languages based on equations that support both continuous-time and event-based aspects. Modelica, SysML, VHDL-AMS and Simulink/Simscape are prominent examples. Using such a language offers a number of advantages: models can be reused, integration can be tested in an early design phase, and simulation code can be generated for a number of different platforms.</p>

<p>The EOOLT workshop addresses the current state of the art of equation-based object-oriented (EOO) modeling languages and explores topics that aim to overcome limits of their expressiveness, correctness, and usefulness. Moreover, integration of and comparison with related approaches and languages, such as actor-oriented, synchronous, and domain specific languages, are of particular interest.</p>

<p>Contributions to this workshop focus on methodological aspects and describe new solutions for the design and use of equation-based languages. In addition to full contributions, shorter work-in-progress papers are welcome, offering an opportunity to discuss current approaches within the community.</p>

<p>Typical subjects of the EOOLT workshop range from language design via modeling aspects to simulation code:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Design aspects of equation-based languages and their formal semantics</li>
  <li>Relation to other languages such as functional reactive programming (FRP) or synchronous languages</li>
  <li>Verification, type systems, and early static checking</li>
  <li>Discrete-event and hybrid system modeling</li>
  <li>Acausality / non-causality and its role in model reusability</li>
  <li>Multi-resolution / multi-scale modeling using EOO languages</li>
  <li>Model-driven development related to EOO languages</li>
  <li>Equation-based modeling in the frame of system engineering</li>
  <li>Reflection and meta-programming</li>
  <li>Environments for modeling, simulation and debugging</li>
  <li>Mathematical formalisms for simulation semantics</li>
  <li>Code generation for real-time systems, embedded system, multi-core platforms, and distributed systems</li>
  <li>Tools for analyzing or optimizing equation-based models</li>

<h4 id="16th-int-modelica--fmi-conference-review">16th Int. Modelica &amp; FMI Conference Review</h4>

<p>We have enjoyed a great community event in the <a href="https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/"><strong>16th International Modelica &amp; FMI conference</strong></a> at Lucerne in September. Thank you for so many interesting discussions and shared ideas at our booth!</p>

<p>The conference started with a well-attended <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn6QDx01uzU"><strong>Workshop on SMArtInt+ (Link to Youtube video)</strong></a> to learn how to integrate and generate AI surrogates from within Dymola.</p>

<p>For the first time we saw a session solely dedicated to Modelica in “Maritime Applications”. Check our <a href="https://doi.org/10.3384/ecp218801"><strong>paper</strong></a> on “Modelica driven development of the thermal management control system for a zero-emission yacht”. It demonstrates how the exported FMU of the thermal energy system modelled with <strong>HVAC Library</strong> can be used to design the control logics outside of the Modelica tool (software in the loop simulation).</p>

<p>In our talk about “Status of the SMArtInt Library” (<a href="https://doi.org/10.3384/ecp218459"><strong>link to paper</strong></a>) we showcased a Modelica realization of the Balanced Neural ODE (BNODE) architecture applied to a ClaRa power plant example, demonstrating the potential of this generic AI-driven non-linear model reduction technique.</p>

<p>Finally, our open-source library <a href="https://github.com/xrg-simulation/SMArtInt"><strong>SMArtInt</strong></a> received the Modelica Library Award (3rd prize) at Lucerne. This encourages us to continue our development towards an open interface for simple generation of Modelica hybrid models that combine the clarity of physics encoded in model equations with the accuracy of real data encoded in AI.</p>

<h4 id="modelica-library-announcements">Modelica Library Announcements</h4>

<p><strong>HumanComfort Library 2.20.0</strong> provides a new 3D soil model for building simulations to represent realistic underground conditions with multiple soil layers. It is a helpful model for the simulation of a variety of foundation types, including semi-basements, making it suitable for more complex building foundation designs. The soil domain can be discretized to capture spatial temperature gradients with a suitable level of detail. Several common soil types are included with physical properties like heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and density, so you can start simulations quickly. Users can also add or adjust soil properties to match specific project requirements. This provides a reliable model for simulating soil-structure interactions in real-world building simulation projects.</p>

<p><img src="3DGroundModel.png" alt="HumanComfort 2.20.0 features" title="New detailed HumanComfort soil model"></p>

<p><strong>HVAC Library 3.5.0</strong> for HVAC system simulation introduces powerful new capabilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A comprehensive <strong>Data Center Cooling Simulation Model</strong> and sub-modules has been added, showcasing an example of a full-year simulation under <strong>hot Abu Dhabi climate conditions</strong>. The climate conditions can easily be changed by using other Energy+ weather data files.
 The system features a <strong>three-stage cooling architecture</strong> with water- and air-cooled components, hybrid recoolers with <strong>free-cooling mode</strong>, CRAH/CDU branches, and chilled-water supply for a 1 MW IT load. 
 The model is suited to perform energy performance studies and comparison of control strategies, evaluation of free-cooling potential, and location-based design optimization — offering a strong reference for real-world data center applications.</li>
  <li>A new <strong>stepwise controller model</strong> with timing and error-handling logic has been added which can be used to control heat pump models.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="DataCenterModel.PNG" alt="HVAC Library 3.5.0 features" title="HVAC Data Center Cooling Simulation Model"></p>

<p><strong>ClaRa+ Library 1.8.0 for energy system simulation introduces powerful new capabilities for modeling liquid systems:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This release adds a set of new liquid components, including pumps, heat exchangers, a balance tank, and junction and splitter models. These components extend the library’s capability to cover a wider range of liquid-based processes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Liquid components now feature a <strong>scalar-quantity stream variable array</strong>, allowing users to transport arbitrary scalar quantities throughout a liquid network. Within liquid volume components, users can formulate <strong>custom source and sink equations</strong> for these scalar quantities. This makes it possible to model phenomena such as delayed neutron precursors, decay-heat precursors, corrosion products, fission products, or any other user-defined tracers with full flexibility.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Together, these enhancements broaden the scope of ClaRa+, enabling advanced liquid transient simulations for research and industrial applications.</p>

<p><strong>SMArtIntPlus 2.0.0</strong> introduces two major new capabilities for integration and training of artificial intelligence in Modelica:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Data Generator</strong>: This new feature allows you to create training and validation datasets directly from Modelica models. Input values are efficiently sampled using <strong>Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)</strong>, covering the desired parameter space. The generator can operate in different modes, supporting both steady-state and dynamic applications.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Network Generator</strong>: Define, train, and export neural networks directly within Modelica. The generator integrates a compiled Python backend with TensorFlow support, enabling the creation of custom network architectures and their export as TensorFlow or TensorFlow Lite models. It also supports <strong>Dimensionless AI</strong> via the <strong>Dedimensionalization-Layer</strong>. The Network Generator makes it easy to create <strong>hybrid models</strong> that combine Neural Networks with physical equations.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="simcenter-amesim-2511-released">Simcenter Amesim 2511 released</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.sw.siemens.com/">Siemens Digital Industries Software</a> is pleased to announce the recent release of <strong>Simcenter&nbsp;Amesim&nbsp;2511</strong> as part of its <a href="https://blogs.sw.siemens.com/simcenter/simcenter-systems-release-2511/">system simulation solutions</a>. This release introduces key updates including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A brand-new help browser with a more modern look and feel.</li>
  <li>A new licensing and deployment model, called <b><a href="https://blogs.sw.siemens.com/simcenter/simcenter-x-advanced-simulation/">Simcenter&nbsp;X&nbsp;Advanced</a></b> that offers ease-of-use and flexibility based on a SaaS approach to licensing.</li>
  <li>An AI-enabled Chat, improving productivity across multi-language teams of <b>Simcenter X Advanced</b> users.</li>

<h4 id="interactive-tool-coupling-fmus-thanks-to-live-and-fully-synchronized-sketch-animation">Interactive Tool-Coupling FMUs thanks to live and fully synchronized Sketch Animation</h4>
<p>Before release 2511, Sketch Animation, one of the key strengths of <strong>Simcenter&nbsp;Amesim</strong>’s post-processing capabilities, could only be activated when <strong>Simcenter&nbsp;Amesim</strong> acted as the main model (FMU importing tool). This is still particularly useful during the Software-in-the-Loop (SiL) phase in which a controller model’s code can be imported to <strong>Simcenter&nbsp;Amesim</strong>. Now, even as of the Model-in-the-Loop (MiL) phase, this powerful capability can be used with a Tool-Coupling FMU exported from <strong>Simcenter&nbsp;Amesim</strong> and imported in the chosen — FMI compliant — Controls Design environment. The below example shows how to get live insight into the behavior of an exported plant model (3.0 FMU) during its coupling with <strong>Simulink</strong> used as external orchestrator. In this case, the Controls Designer gets an improved understanding of simulation results: he/she can directly observe how the controller model interacts with the <strong>Simcenter&nbsp;Amesim</strong> “plant model” via animations that are perfectly synchronized with the post-processing tools of both software, for maximum flexibility and convenience throughout the running co-simulation.</p>

<h2 id="train-fmu-gym-enabling-fmu-based-deep-reinforcement-learning">train_fmu_gym: Enabling FMU-based Deep Reinforcement Learning</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dlr.de/en/fk">DLR Institute of Vehicle Concepts</a>, <a href="https://vsdc.de">Department of Vehicle System Dynamics and Control</a> presents <strong>train_fmu_gym</strong>, a Python-based framework that utilizes the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) to leverage existing simulation models for deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The goal of train_fmu_gym is to enable users to easily set up and start DRL training, as well as evaluate trained agents based on system model FMUs, by providing a sophisticated command line interface (CLI). This allows existing Modelica and other FMI-based models to be reused directly for RL training without modifications to the underlying modeling workflow, bringing data-driven control methods closer to established engineering practice.</p>

<p>train_fmu_gym provides the following key features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Automated generation of DRL environments from FMI 2.0 and FMI 3.0 FMUs</li>
  <li>Flexible handling of different reward implementations and observation sets</li>
  <li>Definition, management, and use of simulation scenarios</li>
  <li>Integration of <a href="https://github.com/DLR-SR/Credibility">Modelica Credibility</a> to define and handle uncertain scenarios</li>
  <li>Definition of evaluation metrics and execution of evaluation simulations to assess trained agents</li>
  <li>Support for setting up, training, and evaluating agents via more than 20 CLI functions</li>
  <li>Platform support for Linux and Windows</li>
</ul>

<p>The toolchain is suitable for users who want a straightforward way to get started with RL on existing models, as well as for users who need deeper customization of environments, reward structures, and evaluation loops. It supports convenient iteration over environment versions and training configurations, enabling systematic experimentation until a satisfactory agent performance is achieved. The framework and example implementations are made openly available via the Helmholtz Cloud GitLab at: https://codebase.helmholtz.cloud/dlr-vsdc/train_fmu_gym</p>

<p>Further information about the framework is provided in the following contribution:</p>

<p><img src="3DS_SuSyDomains.png" alt="SuSy Domains" title="Application domains of the SuSy library"></p>

<p>Dassault Systèmes is happy to announce the release of the <a href="https://blog.3ds.com/brands/catia/catia-dymola-from-concept-to-prototype-in-minutes-simplifying-hybrid-energy-system-modeling-with-the-sustainable-supply-systems-library/">Sustainable Supply Systems library (SuSy)</a>. The SuSy library has been developed for the evaluation and optimization of complex, interconnected energy supply systems across a wide range of industrial applications, including</p>
<ul>
  <li>Battery and renewable energy integration in smart homes, district heating, industrial production facilities</li>
  <li>Alternative drive train technologies and fleet simulations in railway and mining heavy equipment operations</li>
  <li>Marine application with on-vessel energy management and multi-domain interaction of electrical, thermal and steam energy systems</li>
  <li>Aircraft mission design and emission tracking</li>
  <li>General production process simulation with simulated flow of bulk and general materials</li>
</ul>

<p>SuSy focuses on robust, scalable and easy-to-parameterize models. The high level modeling approach enables simulations to be performed with limited available data during early design phases.</p>

<h4 id="new-initiative-to-teach-progressively-modelica-on-linkedin">New initiative to teach progressively Modelica on LinkedIn</h4>

<p>Since mid-September, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/clementcoic/">Clément Coïc</a> launched a LinkedIn newsletter: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/learn-modelica-fmi-7373084674463719424/">Learn Modelica &amp; FMI</a>.  <br>
The idea is simple: we all have busy lives, so if one wants to learn new skills, it should be through <strong>short</strong>, <strong>gradual</strong>, <strong>clear</strong> and <strong>regular</strong> notes or videos that can be consumed during a daily break - like when drinking your morning cup of tea 🫖 or coffee ☕️.</p>

<p>Since then, a dozen of articles have been published explaining <em>Modeling and Simulation</em> best practices, as well as Modelica and FMI concepts, such as causality and acausality.</p>

<h4 id="also-available-on-its-own-website">Also available on its own website</h4>

<p>The LinkedIn newsletter has now also <a href="https://dr-clementcoic.github.io/LearnModelicaFMI/">its own website</a>!  <br>
This makes it easier to find all the content that has been posted and allows for slightly better text formatting.   <br>
This website will also, in the near future, host the models developed for the newsletter.
Articles are still being posted on LinkedIn first, as it remains the best platform to spread the word and exchange ideas on the discussed topics.</p>

<p>Contributions are welcome!  <br>
Just reach out to me.  <br>
