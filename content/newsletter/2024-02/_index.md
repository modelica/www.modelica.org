<h2 id="letter-from-the-board">Letter from the Board</h2>
<p>Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP, eFMI interested,</p>

<p>I am writing to you as the newly elected chairperson of the Modelica Association. After 25 years of inspiring leadership, we could honor the enormous contribution that Prof. Martin Otter made to this association since its official foundation in the year 2000 with a <a href="https://modelica.org/news/2024-05-28-new-board-elected/">celebratory colloquium</a> in Munich. His never-ending drive for new technologies and his incredible know-how in system dynamics ensured that both Modelica and FMI became standards of world-wide recognition. Given this, the board is very grateful that he remains an active part of the <a href="https://modelica.org/association/">Modelica Association</a> in his new role in the board leading technology.</p>

<p>I am very honored by the faith put in my person being elected by our members. It will be my privilege to ensure that Modelica as standard for mathematical modeling becomes even better accessible and easier to learn. We can be proud on the enormous success of the FMI-standard that meanwhile gathered support of more than <a href="https://fmi-standard.org/tools/">200 tools</a>. This inspires us to reach also new levels of popularity on our point of origin: mathematical modeling.</p>

<p>The community is very active in these days, and I am happy to announce many events happening in the near future:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keynote speakers were announced for the <a href="https://modelica.org/events/american2024/">American Modelica Conference 2024</a> this October. We are excited to hear from Swaminathan Gopalswamy, Director of the Connected Autonomous Safe Technologies (CAST) Lab and from Clas A. Jacobson who is Senior Fellow in Systems Engineering at Carrier. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/american-modelica-conference-2024-tickets-794519207337?aff=oddtdtcreator">Registration</a> is open and early bird tickets are available until August 10.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://modelica.org/events/asian2024/call2024/">call for papers</a> for the <a href="https://modelica.org/events/asian2024/">Asian Modelica conference</a> in South Korea is still open. Scientific contributions can be handed in until August 1. Industrial user presentations and tutorials can be proposed until September 1.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the second half of 2024, a number of Modelica related events are located in <strong>Munich, Germany</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>September 4 - 6: I will attend the <a href="https://www.asim-gi.org/asim2024">ASIM Symposium</a> that addresses the German-speaking community for modeling and simulation.</li>
  <li>September 9 - 10: The <a href="https://ltx.de/thermosim/2024">ThermoSim 2024</a> addresses the challenges in modeling and simulating thermal systems.</li>
  <li>December 4-5: The <a href="https://aic.asam.net/main_frontend.php">ASAM international Conference</a> is especially relevant with respect to FMI and related standards.</li>
</ul>

<p>Last but certainly not least, we are now planning the 
<a href="https://modelica.org/news/2024-06-24-16th-modelica-conference-lucerne/">16th International Modelica Conference</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>September 8-10, 2025, in Lucerne, Switzerland. Organized by the University of Lucerne and the Modelica Association.</li>
</ul>

<p>This will be the first visit of our conference tour to Switzerland. The Swiss economy is very active, multifaceted and successful. Many smaller, highly specialized companies are now using system simulation more intensively than before and this conference will be a great opportunity for mutual exchange.</p>

<p><strong>Our community is also growing:</strong> we are very glad to welcome two new organizational members to our association:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.comsol.com/">COMSOL</a> is member since March 13, 2024.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.beckhoff.com/en-en/company/">Beckhoff Automation</a> is member since May 9th 2024.</li>
</ul>

<p>Further growth in advisory members is spurred by the FMI group and communicated in the corresponding FMI news.</p>

<p>If you have interesting news for the Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP, eFMI communities, please 
follow the <a href="https://newsletter.modelica.org/submission-guidelines.html">submission guidelines</a>. The deadline for articles for the next newsletter is Friday, November 15, 2024.</p>

<p><img src="FMI_tools_page.png" alt="FMI tools page"></p>

<p>The <a href="https://fmi-standard.org/tools/">FMI tools page</a> now lists 211 tools supporting tools!</p>

<p>The tools listed on top and marked with the golden star now provide “compatibility information”: 
They document how the tool vendors have tested their FMU import and export capabilities and standard compliance with other tools. 
Exporting tools also provide example FMUs, that can be tested by other importing tools.
This information is provided on an external webpage or repository in the responsibility of the tool vendors.</p>

<p>We see an acceleration in the adoption of FMI 3.0, with 41 tools already supporting it.</p>

<h2 id="map-efmi-beta-1-candidate-draft-of-efmi-standard-1-0-0-released">MAP eFMI®: Beta 1 candidate-draft of eFMI® Standard 1.0.0 released</h2>
<p><img src="MAP-eFMI.png" alt="MAP eFMI®" title="MAP eFMI®"></p>

<h4 id="efmi-standard-100-beta-1-released"><em>eFMI® Standard 1.0.0 Beta 1</em> released</h4>

<p>The next <a href="https://www.efmi-standard.org/standard/#release-cycle-and-versioning">candidate-draft</a>, the <em>eFMI® Standard 1.0.0 Beta 1</em>, for the first official release of the <em>eFMI® Standard</em> has been released! You can find it on the official eFMI® website, https://www.efmi-standard.org/.</p>

<p>This is the first Beta release since the last candidate-draft, the Alpha 4. We are therefore now in beta phase, with each beta finalizing one model representation chapter.</p>

<p>This release focuses on the Behavioral Model representation, whose specification has been finalized and significantly extended and improved to achieve semantic completeness. Among many features, eFMI® Behavioral Models support:</p>

<ul>
  <li>testing of any other eFMI® model representation like Algorithm, Production or Binary Code</li>
  <li>equidistant and variable time grid scenarios, the former with well-defined acceptable time-deviation and the latter with well-defined interpolation semantic</li>
  <li>tolerances configurations defining the absolute and relative error tolerances of variables for various floating-point precisions</li>
  <li>mapping configurations defining how to map variables of any dimensionality (scalar, vector, matrix, or higher dimensionality) to reference trajectories stored in CSV files</li>
  <li>proper handling of time grids w.r.t. actual (i.e., used to conduct a test) and presupposed (i.e., assumed by the test provider) sampling times</li>
  <li>proper handling of units of reference trajectories and tolerances</li>
  <li>testing of error signals, including test scenarios with expected errors</li>
  <li>test scenarios with runtime recalibration of tunable parameters</li>
  <li>clear requirements on test environments and definition of how to conduct a test</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides the <em>“Behavioral Model representation”</em> Chapter, Beta 1 also finalizes the PDF layout and support chapters, like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>footer with standard version, current page number and total, licensing and website link</li>
  <li>use of single open source font family</li>
  <li>blank pages for correct printing</li>
  <li><em>“Legal information”</em> Chapter, now with colophon stating the licenses of used open source fonts, trademarks and disclaimer</li>
  <li>the title page, now with eFMI® logo.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are only minor improvements in the other chapters; they will be focused on and finalized in individual future Beta candidate-drafts. The plan for Beta 2 is to wrap up the current preamble with <em>“Abstract”</em>, <em>“Overview”</em> and <em>“Introduction”</em> Chapters into a single <em>“Overview”</em> Chapter, wrap up and finalize Chapter 1, <em>“General Concepts”</em>, and Chapter 2, <em>“eFMU container architecture”</em>, into a single <em>“Common concepts”</em> chapter, and finalize Chapter 3.1, the <em>“Algorithm Code manifest”</em>.</p>

<p>Testing – and how to define tests, store references, integrate the tooling subject to testing, and make sure different test environments agree on the test results for a certain tooling – is certainly a hot topic for any Modelica Association standard and project. We sincerely hope that the <em>eFMI® Standard 1.0.0 Beta 1</em> provides an excellent starting point for discussion and insights on the challenges of achieving well-defined semantics and completeness, even if “just” for something as “simple” as testing sampled data systems.</p>

<p>If you have any general questions, feedback or improvement proposals for the <em>eFMI® Standard</em>, please follow the <a href="https://www.efmi-standard.org/standard/#reporting-specification-issues-and-new-feature-requests">reporting specification issues and new feature requests guidelines on our website</a> or contact us on our <em>public</em> mailing list, <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/efmi-info"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">efmi-info@googlegroups.com</code></a> (no Google account required).</p>

<h2 id="openmodelica-1-23">OpenModelica 1.23</h2>
<p>Version 1.23.0 of OpenModelica was released on 6 June 2024. It has many improvements and bug fixes compared to 1.22.3 (1.22.4 for Linux),
plus some new useful features, in particular regarding the OMEdit GUI and the FMI export feature. Version 1.23.1 is a minor release with fixes to OMEdit and omc to avoid crashes.</p>

<p>Real parameter values returned by the front-end when flattening models often had bad rounding, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">499.99999999999</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">500</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.00000000000012</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.0</code>.
Also, bad rounding used to plague parameter values with unit conversions driven by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">displayUnit</code> attributes in the OMEdit GUI.
In some cases, very long decimal outputs such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1200000000.0</code> were displayed, instead of the more easily understood <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.2e9</code>.
This issue of proper rounding of decimal numbers was tackled systematically and resolved thanks to rounding algorithms based on the <a href="https://github.com/ulfjack/ryu">Ryu library</a>.</p>

<p>The new front end has been further improved. The front end can now provide clean <a href="https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaSpecification/blob/MCP/0031/RationaleMCP/0031/ReadMe.md">BaseModelica</a>
flat output from the command line; experimental array-preserving flat output can also be obtained.</p>

<p>Most of the work on the backend is still focused on developing the new backend. Two notable improvements are worth mentioning:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the non-standard <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">annotation(tearingSelect)</code> was deprecated and replaced by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">annotation(__OpenModelica_tearingSelect)</code></li>
  <li>according to the <a href="https://specification.modelica.org/maint/3.5/equations.html#initialization-initial-equation-and-initial-algorithm">Modelica Language Specification Sect. 8.6</a>
parameters with no binding and no explicitly set value now cause the compilation to fail, see <a href="https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/issues/10386">#10386</a>.
This may cause some old models to fail during compilation, but it is the required behaviour by the specification, to guard against parameters that are accidentally left without a meaningful value.
The fix is to provide the modifier for the parameters without bindings, or to add an explicit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">start = 0</code> modifier in the library model.</li>
  <li>Issues related to the replaceable components and classes in the parameters
window.</li>
</ul>

<p>The quality of the OMEdit GUI was further improved over the previous version 1.22.3, with about 55 issues fixed. Most of them are bug fixes, but there are also some new features,</p>
<ul>
  <li>Duplicate class feature now works correctly also when the class is duplicated in another scope <a href="https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/issues/5346">#5346</a></li>
  <li>Top-level model parameters can now be edited with the GUI <a href="https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/issues/4408">#4408</a></li>
  <li>Further optimization of the editor’s response time when deleting components and adding/deleting connections <a href="https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/issues/11920">#11920</a></li>
  <li>All rounding issues in the GUI resolved <a href="https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/issues/8865">#8865</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The full 1.23.0 release notes are available <a href="https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/releases/tag/v1.23.0">here</a>.</p>

<p>The next release 1.24.0 is planned to be released in Q4 2024. It should include further improvements to the GUI such as parameter editing in hierarchically structured model,
restructured Simulation Setup dialog, Rename feature with refactoring, faster editing of large models in OMEdit, etc. Further improvements in FMI 2.0.x export are also planned.</p>

<h2 id="dlr-releases-community-updarte-of-the-thermofluid-stream-library">DLR releases Community Updarte of the ThermoFluid Stream Library</h2>
<p><img src="TFSmain.svg" alt="TFS Image" title="Example Thermal Architecture"></p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/DLR-SR/ThermofluidStream">ThermoFluid Stream Library</a> is a free open-source library for the robust modeling and simulation of complex thermal architectures. Since winning the Modelica Library Award in 2021, it steadily grew in popularity.</p>

<p>For this reason, we have organized a <a href="https://github.com/DLR-SR/ThermofluidStream/blob/main/community/2024-06-19-event">community event</a> on June 19 with particiants from all backgrounds: large and small companies, teachers and tool vendors.</p>

<p>In preparation of this event, many new contributions have been made that widen the library’s application field:</p>

<h4 id="new-and-upcoming-features-of-the-dlr-thermofluid-stream-library">New and upcoming Features of the DLR ThermoFluid Stream Library:</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Static head.</strong> Thanks to a contribution from <a href="http://www.saabgroup.com/">Saab</a> components with static head pressure are now available.
    <ul>
      <li>Models for tanks and pipes using static head are now included.</li>
      <li>Gravity acceleration can dynamically change during simulation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>New pipe models.</strong> are added to the library thanks to a contribution from <a href="https://www.htwg-konstanz.de/">HTWG Konstanz</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Models for pipes, bends, diffusors and splitters are now available.</li>
      <li>Validated against Idel’chick.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Improved pump models.</strong> The old pump models was a weak point of the library. There are now two new variants:
    <ul>
      <li>A very simple pumple to be intended as device for mass-flow control</li>
      <li>A pump model of higher fidelity with few selected key parameters for easy specification.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>2-phase Heat Exchanger models</strong> especially for vapor cycles:
    <ul>
      <li>Based on models for condensation and evaporation in pipes from Baehr.</li>
      <li>Validated against our own vapor cycle test rig.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Interface to TIL Media.</strong> In addition to the existin media from the MSL and XRG.
    <ul>
      <li>Customers of the <a href="https://www.tlk-thermo.com/en/software/tilmedia-suite">TIL Media Library</a> can now use these excellent media models in combination with the ThermoFluid Stream.</li>
      <li>The current interface solution is currently regarded as Dymola specfic.</li>
      <li>Such high quality media models can lead to significant performance increase for 2-phase systems.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to improvements in Dymola, critical 2-phase system simulations now perform up to 3 times faster. We also pay attention to maintain compatibility to OpenModelica and other tools such as Modelon Impact.</p>

<p>At the community event, we have recognized that OpenModelica and the ThermoFluid Stream Library are now increasingly used for teaching Thermodynamics such as in the <a href="https://www.peter-junglas.de/fh/talks/2024-dlr/html/index.html">examples of Peter Junglas</a>.</p>

<h2 id="process-systems-library-dynamic-simulation-of-power-to-x-processes">Process Systems Library – Dynamic Simulation of Power-to-X Processes</h2>
<p>For the past 5 years, TLK Energy has been developing a flexible and powerful Modelica library for process engineering. It has gone through several stages of development, from using Multiflash from KBC to calculate physical properties, to a completely new approach in calculating the state variables of the medium, to a stand-alone, affordable library compatible with Dymola and Modelon Impact. Instead of the usual calculation method using equilibrium states, phase properties are calculated separately, which offers more possibilities for parameterization. This makes it possible to simulate processes that were previously difficult to implement. Now the Process Systems Library (PSL) enables the simulation of many Power-to-X processes, from water electrolysis and carbon capture to synthesizing complex chemicals like methane or methanol.</p>
<h4 id="example-model-pem-electrolyzer-stack-cooling">Example model: PEM Electrolyzer stack cooling</h4>
<p>PEM electrolysis is highly efficient for hydrogen production, but to ensure optimal performance, the stack must be properly cooled. Reusing the waste heat can enhance the energy efficiency of the entire system.</p>

<p><img src="PSL-Power-to-X_system.jpg" alt="system" title="system"></p>

<p>During the electrolysis of water to hydrogen, waste heat needs to be removed for efficient operation. Many PEM stack manufacturers specify a maximum temperature rise (ΔTmax) between the incoming and outgoing reactant streams. Exceeding ΔTmax reduces the stack’s lifespan and compromises system economics.</p>

<p>Adjusting the incoming mass flow controls the temperature rise, ensuring ΔTmax is not exceeded. Beyond a certain water mass flow, hydrogen production remains constant, but increased water flow enhances stack cooling. Minimizing pump power consumption involves keeping the mass flow as low as possible while maintaining ΔTmax.</p>

<p>A suitable control strategy helps maintain this optimal temperature rise dynamically. The PSL provides a simulation-ready example model that accounts for all these parameters, aiding in developing an appropriate operation for individual applications.</p>

<p>If you are wondering if PSL is suitable for your process and would like to know more or get a trial license, please contact us: <a href="mailto:info@tlk-energy.de">info@tlk-energy.de</a></p>

<p><strong>Our new generalized simulation interface - Censeo</strong></p>

<p>Over the years, there have been numerous instances where we have had the need for an easily configurable generalized simulation interface, often referred to as a graphical user interface (or GUI for short), to serve as a way for a user to alter inputs to a particular simulation model without the full overhead of the development interface (Dymola).</p>
