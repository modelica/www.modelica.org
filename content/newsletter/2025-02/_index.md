<h2 id="letter-from-the-board">Letter from the Board</h2>
<p>Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP, eFMI interested,</p>

<p>This newsletter is full of anticipation for our upcoming main event: the <a href="https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/">16th international Modelica &amp; FMI conference</a>!
Our standards progress and so does the format of our conference. We decided very early on to make it a Modelica &amp; FMI conference so that even people only interested in one of our standards can enjoy a full program. We have further strengthened this by elevating the Industrial User presentation to have their own track enabling a better exchange within industry experts but also between industry and academia. You can plan your visit with the <a href="https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/16thModelicaFMI_PrelProgram.pdf">preliminary program</a>.</p>

<p>The different scientific tracks nicely represent the multi-faceted aspects of our standards:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The use of models in AI and the use of AI in models have revitalized classic control applications. Hence the topic “Control and AI” forms its own track. The first <a href="https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/#keynotes">keynote of Mishra Siddhartha</a> will enhance this topic.</li>
  <li>Energy systems have always played a dominant part in the Modelica ecosystem and enjoy their track. The second <a href="https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/#keynotes">keynote by Johan Åkesson</a> further stresses this point.</li>
  <li>The track on FMI and related (layered) standards goes just beyond the usage of our standards. Advanced handling of meta-information and the integration into MBSE workflows are major topics.</li>
  <li>and last but not least: where else shall you discuss the development of equation-based modeling and their tooling than in a track for “General Modelica” at our conference?</li>
</ul>

<p>I want to thank all the reviewers and my fellows from the conference board on the tremendous effort they have put into their reviewing effort. Most importantly, I want to express my highest gratitude towards all our authors and contributors. This exciting program would not have been possible without all your work that went into creating these submissions.</p>

<p>The eagerness of our community to contribute to the greater good and to educate is best displayed by the tutorials. We can offer <a href="https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/Tutorial_Abstracts_16th_Modelica_and_FMI_Conference.pdf">15 tutorials</a> in parallel. This is fantastic to see and fortunately we have with the HSLU also a wonderful venue that is able to stage all these sessions. Do not forget to fill out the <a href="https://terminplaner6.dfn.de/en/e/d590fb98fe94c51b446157009fca9395-1294761">tutorial questionnaire</a> once you have registered for the conference!</p>

<p>Being part of the conference board, I also appreciate the strong commitment of our sponsors. I want to thank our Platinum sponsor <a href="https://www.ltx.de/english.html">LTX</a>, our gold sponsors <a href="https://www.3ds.com/">Dassault Systèmes</a>, <a href="https://modelon.com/">Modelon</a>, <a href="https://www.tongyuan.cc/">Tongyuan</a>  and our silver sponsors <a href="https://juliahub.com/">JuliaHub</a>, <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/index.en.html?source=footer">Wolfram</a>, <a href="https://xrg-simulation.de/en">xRG</a>, <a href="https://www.orthogonal.dev/">Orthogonal</a>, <a href="https://openmodelica.org/">OpenModelica</a>, <a href="https://www.asam.net/">ASAM</a>,  <a href="https://www.exxcellent.de/">exxcellent</a>, <a href="https://www.claytex.com/">ClayTex</a>. If you want to learn more about them, visit the vendor session at the evening of day 1.  Most of them will be also present by a booth for the full duration of the conference. Also more sponsors may still be joining the conference.</p>

<p>I hope that you will enjoy the refreshed format and the packed program and that I will see many of you at the conference.</p>

<h4 id="panel-discussion">Panel Discussion</h4>

<p>For the first time at the International Modelica Conference, we will have a Penel discussion. The topic is: <strong>Open Standards vs. Open source, Collaboration or Conflict?</strong>.</p>

<p>We choose panelist from a braod range of companies and organizations using Modelica for their product design and research. Our distinguished Panelists are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adam Moravanszky, Senior Director Simulation Technology,  NVIDIA</li>
  <li>Clément Coïc, Technology Cluster Lead - Digital Mechatronics, Siemens Healthineers</li>
  <li>Dirk Zimmer (Chairman Modelica Association), Coordinator for M&amp;S Methods and Tools, DLR</li>
  <li>Marius Dupuis, CEO, ASAM e.V.</li>
  <li>Michael Wetter, Computational Senior Scientist, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)</li>
  <li>Ulrich Schulmeister, VP Technology and Engineering, Robert Bosch GmbH</li>
</ul>

<p>The panel discussion will evolve around a few prepared questions, and questions from the audience. It will be moderated by our board member Hubertus Tummescheit, (Board member Modelica Association), President Model Based Innovation LLC.</p>

<h4 id="post-conference-activity">Post Conference Activity</h4>

<p>For many of us, the conference is also an ideal opportunity to meet in person. This shall be exploited beyond the main event.</p>

<p>To get important feedback from our user-base, we stage an FMI Advisory Meeting (register <a href="mailto:contact@fmi-standard.org">via email</a>) and also a Modelica Advisory Meeting (<a href="https://terminplaner6.dfn.de/en/b/b8ceacb2fd2032bbbf901583f997f728-1284258">register here</a>) on Thursday morning right after the conference. These events are open for everyone who wants to give use feedback, present challenges or propose improvements.</p>

<p>From Thursday afternoon to Friday afternoon, we have hold meetings for the individual working groups and for the overall coordination and strategy of our association.</p>

<p>These meetings are for Modelica Association members only. Registration info has been communicated by email.</p>

<h4 id="modelica-in-china">Modelica in China</h4>

<p>I have decided to visit our Modelica user base in China and hence have undertaken a journey through 6 cities in mainland China this May. This journey let me exchange with Modelica and FMI users, with academia, with industry and with main tool developers and consultants in systems engineering from various technical fields.</p>

<p>I think it is nearly impossible to return as a European from China and not being impressed. Its industry is firing on all cylinders but even more so, the spirit of growth and relentless progress is permeating through its society as a whole. It is a tangible and useful form of progress benefitting wealth, technology, environmental protection and health.</p>

<p>Yet, I was still surprised to see how many fellow Modelicans there are in this country. Indeed, there might be more users of Modelica in China than in the rest of the world combined! For this fortunate situation, we have to thank the initiatives and hard work of many individuals and organizations, both local companies with their own independent tooling and international companies importing software. Chinese teaching material is being created, a Chinese version of the MSL 4.0 exists and demand comes from all industry sectors (and all means all in China).</p>

<p>Despite this fortunate situation, we shall not overlook that the Modelica Association is lacking awareness in China and that some efforts are fragmented. As an international association we have to strengthen Modelica as a community where people help and educate each other. This effort shall also focus on China but not being limited to it and apply for Asia as a whole.</p>

<p>I will come back to this topic in future newsletters and report on very concrete actions that are undertaken in this direction. For now, I want to express my gratitude for all the hospitality I did receive from university professors and their students, from industrial groups, companies and vendors. There are simply too many people to mention here but I was feeling truly honored to have the opportunity to hold lectures and fully enjoyed the technical discussions.</p>

<p>A special thank you goes to Dr. Rui Gao. Without his planning and coordination, the trip would have simply been impossible. I am also extremely grateful to Dr. Aiguo Xu and Ms. Jiayan Zhou from SimTek who have greatly supported this trip all the way (so many organizational things and so many miles travelled) and to Dr. Fanli Zhou from Tongyuan for hosting me in my final destination in Suzhou.</p>

<p>As it turns out, this introduction to the newsletter got quite lengthy. I promise to be more concise in the future but it might be also a good sign that there are so many important developments to report on.</p>

<p>Have fun with the newsletter and see you at the conference!</p>

<h4 id="news-from-the-fmi-project">News from the FMI Project</h4>

<p>The FMI Project actively maintains the FMI 2.0.x and 3.0.x standards, and currently focusses on the development of Layered Standards to extend FMI for new application domains:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-xcp">FMI-LS-XCP</a> v1.0.0 released in Dec 2024: This layered standard defines support for <a href="https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/mcd-1-xcp/">XCP</a> or “Universal Measurement and Calibration Protocol”, a network protocol defined by <a href="https://www.asam.net/">ASAM</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-bus">FMI-LS-BUS</a> v1.0.0 just released, see below. This layered standard defines how to realize the simulation of network communication with FMI 3.0 means.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-struct">FMI-LS-STRUCT</a> v1.0.0-alpha.1 prerelease: Based on FMI 3.0, this layered standard defines how variables (especially parameters) of an FMU can be structured and grouped in a more flexible way than with the “structured naming convention” of the FMI Standard. The first version of this layered standard is focused on the definition of sampled maps.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-ref">FMI-LS-REF</a> (in development). It will allow for the inclusion of related files into an FMU. This includes parameter sets, reference stimuli and results, which can be used in additional experiments, as well as other relevant files to the FMU, like the model sources, requirements, or specifications.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally two new working groups for the improvement of efficiency of data communication between FMUs and for DAE support have been formed.</p>

<h5 id="the-fmi-layered-standard-for-network-communication-v10-has-been-released---enabling-the-simulation-of-virtual-ecus-with-fmi-30">The FMI Layered Standard for Network Communication v1.0 has been released - enabling the simulation of virtual ECUs with FMI 3.0!</h5>

<p><img src="FMI-LS-BUS.png" alt="FMI-LS-BUS"></p>

<p>Increasingly complex supply chains and functional diversity in the creation of virtual ECUs (vECUs) require standardization to ensure the simple and cost-efficient exchange of vECUs for users of Software-in-the-Loop (SiL) testing solutions. FMI is an established standard for creating vECUs already using the FMI versions 1.0 and 2.0, but the capabilities for these applications has been improved significantly with the release of FMI 3.0 in 2022. Additionally FMI 3.0 allows for the specification of layered standards. These are defined based on the FMI 3.0 core standard and extend its capability for specific usage domains, in the case of the new Layered Standard the network Communication of vECUs:</p>

<p>CAN, CAN FD, CAN XL, LIN, FlexRay and Ethernet are network technologies that have been applied successfully over many years by all automotive OEMs worldwide. Virtualizing ECUs and then simulating such vECUs requires connecting them using a virtual version of these network technologies.</p>

<p>The layered standard defines what input and output variables and which FMI 3.0 features are used and how to emulate a transport layer for such network traffic. At this point it should be explicitly mentioned that this layered standard not only relates to automotive buses, but can also be extended to buses from other domains in the future.</p>

<p>There are two base use cases enabled:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Physical Signal Abstraction (or High-Cut) to simply transport physical signal values between virtual ECUs:
The network properties are largely idealized: Infinite bandwidth, zero-delay etc. Signals, groups of signals and their properties (e.g., units) are usually derived from existing and validated standard network topology description formats, such as DBC, LDF, Fibex and ARXML.</li>
  <li>Network Abstraction (or Low-Cut) to realize virtualized bus driver implementations:
This transport layer emulation allows anything from idealized to more detailed network simulations, including bandwidth restrictions, message arbitration and delays. It forwards the network payloads using binary variables. The Low-Cut abstraction layer is meant to allow virtualized bus driver implementations, including feedback from the physical drivers about transmission status or network node states. Since the Network Abstraction layer is protocol-independent, it can also be used for the simulation of non-automotive control units, e.g., from the field of industrial automation.</li>
</ul>

<p>The FMI Layered Standard for Network Communication (FMI-LS-BUS) has been created in a collaborative effort by a working group within the FMI Project with contributions from Akkodis, AVL, Beckhoff, Bosch, dSPACE, PMSF and Synopsys (in alphabetical order).</p>

<p>The FMI Steering Committee has now released the version v1.0 of the FMI 3.0 Layered Standard for Network Communication (FMI-LS-BUS). This version includes the common Physical Signal Abstraction, that fits for all bus types, and the Network Abstraction that supports CAN, CAN FD, CAN XL. Additionally a pre-release of FMI-LS-BS v1.1.0-beta was published supporting the next planned bus types FlexRay and Ethernet. A chronological overview of the supported and planned bus types can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-bus?tab=readme-ov-file#roadmap">FMI-LS-BUS Roadmap</a>.</p>

<p>The new Layered Standard has been heavily tested during the development, and already is supported by the following tools: 
Altair Twin Activate, AVL Model.CONNECT, dSPACE SystemDesk, dSPACE VEOS, Synopsys Silver, Vector SIL Kit, Vector vVIRTUALtarget (for more information see  https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-bus)</p>

<p>The FMI Layered Standard for Network Communication is accompanied by other layered standards to improve the simulation of vECUs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The FMI-LS-XCP (v1.0 released, see https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-xcp) which enables the measurements via the ASAM XCP standard</li>
  <li>The FMI Layered Standard for the Structuring of data (FMI-LS-STRUCT, v1.0-alpha available, see https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-struct) which defines support for maps.</li>
</ul>

<p>Together they represent a significant part of the functionality required for carrying out SiL tests in vECUs by using the popular FMI 3.0 standard. 
They enable the faster exchange of vECUs and give users the option of tool freedom when creating and simulating vECUs. Ultimately, this reduces the process complexity for exchanging and makes it significantly more cost-efficient to create and simulate vECUs.</p>

<p>We will present the new Layered Standard for Network communication also at the coming “16th International Modelica and FMI Conference” in Lucerne, Sept 8-10 2025, in our talk “FMI Layered Standard for Network Communication: Applications in Networked ECU Development”. <a href="https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/">Come and meet us there</a>!</p>

<p><img src="eFMI-tutorial.png" alt="eFMI® Tutorial" title="eFMI® Tutorial" width="620px"></p>

<p><strong>Time:</strong> Monday, 08/Sep/2025, 1:30pm–4:45pm (including 30min coffee break)</p>

<p>We are happy to announce that there will be an extensive <a href="https://www.efmi-standard.org/">eFMI®</a> tutorial at the upcoming <a href="https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/">16th International Modelica &amp; FMI Conference</a>.</p>

<p>The tutorial will demonstrate the current state-of-the-art of available eFMI® tooling. Participants will get a very high-level overview of the eFMI® workflow from acausal physics models in Modelica® down to embedded target code and a <em>hands-on</em> experience of it for selected Modelica® examples. The generated eFMUs and their various intermediate model representations are investigated, focusing on the non-functional quality criteria satisfied by the generated solutions, like traceability within eFMUs, MISRA C:2023 compliance of generated production code and other code quality criteria like static memory allocation and error handling.</p>

<p>Compared to the tutorial at the last <a href="https://2023.international.conference.modelica.org/">International Modelica Conference in 2023</a>, we will investigate more advanced examples like hybrid physics and neural network (NN) models where unknown non-linear physics are modeled using NN surrogate models well integrated with known physics (so called physics-enhanced neural ordinary differential equations, PeN-ODEs). Also the latest eFMI® improvements will be presented, like tooling to import eFMI® Production Code in MATLAB®/Simulink®, the new standard library of GALEC built-in functions and others.</p>

<p>Expected experience of participants:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No previous experience with eFMI®.</li>
  <li>Moderate knowledge of Modelica®.</li>
  <li>Good understanding of physics/equation-based modeling.</li>
  <li>Little/moderate knowledge of the embedded domain and its challenges.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="FMI-tutorial-logo.png" alt="FMI Tutorial" title="FMI Tutorial" width="250px"></p>

<p><strong>Time:</strong> Monday, 08/Sep/2025, 1:30pm–4:45pm (including 30min coffee break)</p>

<p>We are happy to announce that there will be an extensive <a href="https://fmi-standard.org/">FMI</a> tutorial at the upcoming <a href="https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/">16th International Modelica &amp; FMI Conference</a>.</p>

<p>In this tutorial we show how to write a simple FMI 3.0 implementation for a Co-Simulation FMU in C code. Starting with a minimalistic code framework we explain the implementation of all required functions and give best-practice recommendations on implementing error handling. The first part of the tutorial session is completed by building the FMU and simulating it in an FMI master program.</p>

<p>Next we present the steps on how to import an FMU into a software. Again, focus lies on implementation of the necessary functions and implementation of robust error handling. The FMU created in the first part is imported and run through a prepared simulation loop. Using the debugger we follow the function calls and develop an understanding of how the FMI master interacts with the FMU and how data is being exchanged.</p>

<p>We show how to build the FMU and the master program using platform-specific compiler tool chains. Participants can use their own development environment or use a prepared online compiler and development environment.</p>

<h2 id="modiator-modelica-in-the-browser">Modiator - Modelica in the Browser</h2>
<h4 id="modiator">Modiator</h4>
<p>Modiator (Modelica Instant Simulator) is a simulator for a subset of Modelica with some extensions. The compilations and simulations can run in the browser on desktops, laptops, tablets, mobiles, or using node.js to run on IoT devices or on the cloud. Modiator is based on pure JavaScript modules with the simulator based on Sundials compiled into WebAssembly. Modiator UI has a library browser, drag&amp;drop Modelica diagram editing, Modelica text editor, plotting, Monte Carlo simulator and analyzer, 3D animation, etc.</p>

<p>Modiator 0.1.0 will be released on September 8 at the <a href="https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/">Modelica and FMI Conference, Luzern</a>.</p>

<h4 id="tutorial-at-the-conference">Tutorial at the Conference</h4>
<p>Modiator will be used during a tutorial at the conference. The participants will start to develop a Modelica web app simulator with a specialized user interface for a certain model/domain. The specific user Modelica model can be developed using the Modiator UI. A web app template will be provided which calls the Modiator API to compile and simulate Modelica models. The participants will adapt this template to get a desired user interface for experimenting with their specific model. Alternatively, AI tools can be used to produce a first Modelica model of the application and a first version of the HTML and JavaScript code of the web app.</p>

<h4 id="orchideo--easyssp-v142-released">orchideo | easySSP v1.4.2 released</h4>

<p>The new <strong>easySSP version 1.4.2</strong> introduces <strong>hierarchical parameter handling</strong> for component synchronization, making it easier to display and override parameters defined at higher system levels. Additionally, a new merge function for parameter bindings allows for more efficient consolidation of parameter configurations.</p>

<p>Building on existing functionality, <strong>subsystems and components</strong> can now be exported and imported as <strong>System Structure Description (SSD)</strong> files. Components can reference SSDs for improved reuse, and a new <strong>convert feature</strong> enables seamless switching between systems and components — while preserving connectors, parameters, and metadata.</p>

<p><strong>Workflow capabilities</strong> have also been extended: <strong>dynamic workflow parts</strong> and <strong>workflow variables</strong> now enable a more flexible, user-specific process guidance and documentation. Moreover, multiple workflows can be bundled within a single SSP container and selected via the navigation bar.</p>

<p>To further support metadata exchange and model reuse, easySSP now offers flexible <strong>import and export of classifications</strong> in the <strong>Simulation Resource Metadata (SRMD)</strong> format, covering all metadata scopes within the app.</p>

<p><strong>easySSP</strong> is based entirely on open standards like <strong>SSP</strong>, <strong>FMI</strong>, and <strong>SSP Traceability</strong>. Learn more at <a href="https://easy-ssp.com">easy-ssp.com</a>.</p>

This release introduces key updates including further more accelerated simulations and improved model validation tools. Enhancements target electrification with new battery and heat exchanger assistants, electrochemical aging simulations, and hydrogen applications with components for electrolyzer and cryogenic storage modeling. It also supports the import of 3.0 Functional Mockup Units (FMUs) for co-simulation, as described hereafter.</p>

<p><img src="amesim_banner_2504.png" alt=""></p>

<h4 id="import-of-30-fmus-for-co-simulation">Import of 3.0 FMUs for co-simulation</h4>
<p>To further extend the capabilities of <strong>Simcenter Amesim</strong> as heterogeneous model integration platform, the import of 3.0 FMUs for co-simulation has been implemented. 
Fixed-size FMI 3.0 <em>arrays</em> are supported as well as <em>tunable</em> elements/parameters. Expected benefits for users are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A direct import of virtual ECUs, typically with arrays.</li>
  <li>The capability to orchestrate multiple 3.0 and 2.0 FMUs within the same model, while using distinct run settings for each FMU.</li>
</ul>

<p>Test FMUs from Simulink, Dymola, Twin Activate, MapleSim and other tools have been successfully imported and simulated during the implementation phase.
The below picture shows an example of 3.0 FMU imported to a real-time capable <strong>Simcenter Amesim</strong> hydraulic excavator model, whose execution is synchronized with the wall clock time.
The FMU comes from Simulink R2025a. It features an FMI array output represented by a vector, as well as tunable parameters, allowing to change the value of this vector. These tunable parameters are used to control the excavator.</p>

<p>To bridge the gap between HVAC system design and real-world performance, Takenaka Corporation—one of Japan’s leading engineering contractors—partnered with Modelon. Leveraging Modelon Impact’s physics-based modeling and seamless integration with EnergyPlus, Takenaka developed a high-fidelity HVAC system simulation for a standard office floor. This enabled more accurate control logic tuning, operational optimization, and laid the groundwork for future modeling of larger buildings. The collaboration not only improved energy performance but also strengthened Takenaka’s internal simulation capabilities, supporting their long-term vision for energy-efficient, comfortable Net Zero Energy Buildings (ZEBs).</p>
