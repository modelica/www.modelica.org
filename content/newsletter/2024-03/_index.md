<h2 id="letter-from-the-board">Letter from the Board</h2>
<p>Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP, eFMI interested,</p>

<p>Since a long time, the Modelica Association is more than just Modelica. It is managing a broad set of topics and doing so effectively by distributing the workload among its different Modelica Association Projects.  However, there are common problems that require us to join forces across the projects. Hence this autumn we have re-initiated the coordination of our projects with a Modelica Coordination Meeting in Hamburg, Germany.
The four most important results of this discussion were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provision of a free FMU import library. The Modelica Language group will then discuss extensions to the Modelica language to enable better means for FMU import across Modelica tools</li>
  <li>Development of free educational material in general to lower entry barrier for Modelica.</li>
  <li>Development of free educational material for the use of SSP in modeling and simulation workflows</li>
  <li>Exploration of APIs for Modelica compilers to enable better integration into coding environments and AI tools or build toolchains.</li>
</ul>

<p>I want to thank Airbus Operations GmbH for hosting this event and Oliver Lenord (Project Leader of <a href="https://itea4.org/project/openscaling.html">ITEA OpenScaling</a>) for enabling this to be adjunct to the OpenScaling workshop.  This meeting was a first step and further coordination is planned:  a virtual online meeting is scheduled for January 31 in 2025 and another in-person meeting will be organized in spring 2025, likely to be in Hamburg again. Invitation will be sent out to all Modelica Association members via email.</p>

<h4 id="update-on-our-conferences">Update on our conferences</h4>

<p>The last quarter of 2024 is all about our conferences in the USA and Asia. The <a href="https://modelica.org/events/american2024/">American conference</a> was a very successful event and its <a href="https://modelica.org/events/american2024/271463_Modelica_Storrs_Proceedings_v3_SinglePages.pdf">proceedings</a> are now available. I want to sincerely thank the very experienced local organization team for all their hard work and also for bringing a wonderful community together. I am also looking forward to participate in the <a href="https://modelica.org/events/asian2024/">Asian Modelica Conference</a> in South Korea this December.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I am happy to announce the annual <a href="https://modprodblog.wordpress.com/">ModProd and OpenModelica Workshop</a> in Linköping, taking place at February 3-5.</p>

<p>Last but certainly not least: Preparation for the <a href="https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/">16th International Modelica &amp; FMI Conference</a> in beautiful Lucerne, Switzerland are now speeding up.  Of highest interest are of course the most important dates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>April 17, 2025: Deadline for submissions</li>
  <li>June 1, 2025:	Deadline for Workshops and Tutorials, and Vendor Presentations</li>
  <li>June 1, 2025:	Deadline for Industrial User Presentation submissions</li>
  <li>September 8-10, 2025:	16th International Modelica &amp; FMI Conference</li>
</ul>

<p>More details are available on the <a href="https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/">conference website</a> as well as the <a href="https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/callforsponsors25/">call for sponsors</a>. The conference will also hold a track for industrial user presentations. This provides an opportunity for industry to report on their successes and challenges without the burden of writing a full academic paper. The Modelica conference series has always been very succesfull in bringing academic research and industrial users together.</p>

<p>The project <a href="https://projects.rail-research.europa.eu/eurail-fp1/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FP1-MOTIONAL</code></a>, implemented by Europe’s Rail Joint Undertaking (<a href="https://rail-research.europa.eu/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EU Rail</code></a>) and running from 2022-2026, addresses digitalization and data exploitation as a transversal topic essential for many innovation fields in railways such as automation, asset management, operational optimization and new sustainable rail system and service solutions.</p>

<p>The Work Stream 2 of the project aims at organizing in particular the modularity, interoperability and composability of the complex high-order digital twins. The figure below, provided by the partner <a href="https://www.cafmobility.com/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CAF</code></a>,  exemplifies a system architecture currently under consideration to implement a digital twin for braking and traction.</p>

<p><img src="CAFArchitecture.png" alt="CAF Use Case Architecture" title="Architecture Braking &amp; Traction Use Case"></p>

<p>The <a href="https://fmi-standard.org/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Functional Mock-up Interface</code></a> has been selected as the standard exchange format for model components to enable the reuse of existing models and tools and to allow  IP-Protection of model content from commercial suppliers. Special attention in the use case driven work is given to a proper design of interfaces, i.e. the in- and output quantities of component FMUs. It is the goal to deliver a range of digital twin assembly templates similar to the <a href="https://github.com/modelica/VehicleInterfaces"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vehicle Interfaces Library</code></a> in the automotive field. In order to prepare the future business case, the digital twins will be  compliant and  integrated into in the data ecosystem called <a href="https://internationaldataspaces.org/usecases/european-rail-data-space/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rail Data Space</code></a>, also addressed within <a href="https://projects.rail-research.europa.eu/eurail-fp1/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FP1-MOTIONAL</code></a>.</p>

<p><img src="easySSP-logo.png" alt="orchideo | easySSP v1.3.8 is now available with workflows, SSP 2.0 support and enhanced model parameterization" title="orchideo \| easySSP v1.3.8"></p>

<p>The latest easySSP update brings workflows, SSP 2.0 support and enhanced model parameterization:</p>

<p>The new <strong>Workflow functionality</strong> provides step-by-step interactive guidance directly within SSP containers. Workflow widgets support user inputs, metadata mapping, and seamless integration with SSP models and SSP Traceability data. Workflow documentation is automatically generated in Markdown, ensuring compatibility and easy sharing.</p>

<p><strong>SSP 2.0 (BETA)</strong> support is now available, enabling more flexible model connectors, acausal connections and new FMI 3.0 compliant data types. While SSP 2.0 is still under development, easySSP already allows for importing, editing, and exporting models as SSP 2.0, paving the way for the upcoming standard.</p>

<p>The addition of <strong>Hierarchical Parameterization</strong> simplifies the management of model parameters. Parameters can now be defined globally or customized at component and system levels, providing flexibility while remaining fully SSP-compliant.</p>

<p><strong>easySSP</strong> is completely based on open standards like SSP, FMI and SSP Traceability. Check out <a href="https://easy-ssp.com">easy-ssp.com</a> for more information!</p>

<p>Our newest product <a href="https://xrg-simulation.de/en/seiten/smartint"><strong>SMArtInt+</strong></a> enables hybrid physical and data-driven modelling in Modelica in a simple and convenient way. It has been developed and successfully validated in two recently finished research projects (PHyMoS and DIZPROVI). The <strong>Simple Modelica Artificial Intelligence Interface</strong> offers Modelica and Python tools that will help you to easily integrate neural networks of different sources and kinds in your Modelica models. It uses standardized interfaces, models and methods from the open source SMArtInt Library which is available from <a href="https://github.com/xrg-simulation/SMArtIInt">Github</a>.</p>

<p><img src="xrg-SMArtInt+-library.png" alt="SMArtInt+ Logo" title="SMArtInt+ Logo"></p>

<h4 id="use-case">Use Case</h4>

<p>There are endless applications to this <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2024/press-release/">noble-prize winning approach</a>. For instance, modelling and validation heat transfer or pressure loss is a complex task in technical applications when accuracy needs to be high. In one of our research projects the aim was to replace a physical ClaRa model of a flue-gas heat exchanger with a hybrid version using measurement data from the original plant (kindly provided by <a href="https://www.leag.de/en/">LEAG</a>). The hybrid model was clearly fitting the heat flow rate much more accurate as the figures reveal in comparison to the physical model.</p>

<h2 id="simcenter-amesim-2410">Simcenter Amesim 2410</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.sw.siemens.com/">Siemens Digital Industries Software</a> is pleased to announce the recent release of <strong>Simcenter&nbsp;Amesim&nbsp;2410</strong> as part of its <a href="https://blogs.sw.siemens.com/simcenter/whats-new-simcenter-systems-2410/">system simulation solutions</a>. This release brings remarkable performance improvements to the solver and code generation that combine well with previous optimizations such as those related to so-called “0-flow” problems or to discontinuity handling in a co-simulation context. These improvements have a positive impact on the support of FMI and Modelica.</p>

<p><img src="amesim_banner_2410.png" alt=""></p>

<h4 id="accelerated-simulations">Accelerated simulations</h4>
<p>While the original aim was to speed up the simulation of Pseudo-Two-Dimensional (P2D) battery models 
—&nbsp;achieved with a speedup factor of about&nbsp;9 compared to release 2404&nbsp;—, two <em>generic</em> solver enhancements 
have been implemented which have tangible positive consequences on all kinds of “large” 
models, including native models but also Modelica models and imported Model Exchange FMUs, as soon as the —&nbsp;default&nbsp;— variable step solver is selected. These enhancements, activated by default, are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A new heuristic for optimized calculations of Jacobian matrices,</li>
  <li>An optimized handling of sparse linear systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>“Large” models represent a strong trend for system simulation across all industries, for example to serve electrification. They typically involve fine-grained spatial discretizations, numerous inputs/outputs, state variables, internal variables and/or parameters.</p>

<h4 id="improved-code-generation-for-modelica-and-imported-fmus">Improved code generation for Modelica and imported FMUs</h4>
<p>Aside from accelerated simulations, the code generation performed when creating a Modelica 
model, importing an FMU, a pre-trained neural network (<a href="https://onnx.ai/">ONNX</a> file) or a response surface, 
has been upgraded to “V2”, featuring lightweight and more CPU-efficient code. 
For Modelica and FMI, the 
outcome is a more robust coupled simulation with “large” models. For highly-hierachical Modelica
models, this results in compilation and simulation times that compete with 100% Modelica-based tools,
for example with models coming from Lawrence Berkeley’s open-source <a href="https://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/">Buildings Library v11.0.0</a>.</p>

<p><img src="amesim_modelica_2410.png" alt=""></p>

<h4 id="fast-running-exported-co-simulation-fmus">Fast-running exported co-simulation FMUs</h4>
<p>Obviously, the above-mentioned solver improvements for native or hybridized models are automatically reflected&nbsp;—&nbsp;<em>embedded</em>&nbsp;—&nbsp; in exported FMUs for co-simulation, for the deployment of performant <em>plant models</em>. Combined with the optimized discontinuity handling introduced in release 2304, the speedup is further maximized in this context since at each co-simulation <em>rendez-vous</em> point, the solver’s current pace is kept unchanged whenever possible. 
This strategy is in place independently of the chosen import tool. A typical use case is when the <strong>Simcenter&nbsp;Amesim</strong> FMU is connected to a controller model whose outputs may have changed little or not at all during a co-simulation time step.</p>

<h2 id="openmodelica-1-24-0">OpenModelica 1.24.0</h2>
<p>Version 1.24.0 of OpenModelica was released on 9th October 2024. It has many improvements and bug fixes. Graphical Editor (OMEdit) was updated to support both Qt5 and Qt6.</p>

<h4 id="openmodelica-compiler-omc">OpenModelica Compiler (OMC)</h4>

<p>The new front end has been further improved with about 25 issues solved, here is a <a href="https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A1.24.0+label%3ACOMP%2FOMC%2FFrontend+is%3Aclosed+">complete list</a>. <a href="https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A1.24.0+label%3A%22COMP%2FBase+Modelica%22+">Nine of those issues</a> regarded fixes to the new experimental <a href="https://openmodelica.org/doc/OpenModelicaUsersGuide/latest/basemodelica.html#flattening-models-to-basemodelica">Base Modelica flat output</a>.</p>

<p>A new compiler flag <a href="https://openmodelica.org/doc/OpenModelicaUsersGuide/latest/omchelptext.html#omcflag-exposelocalios">–exposeLocalIOs</a> was added to automatically add the outputs of a model components to the outputs of an FMU, instead of only adding the top-level outputs. This can easily provide monitoring information in an FMU without the need of painstakingly bring all those outputs to the top level in the original Modelica model.</p>

<p>Besides <a href="https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/issues/12730">#12730</a>, the work on the backend was mostly focused on developing the new backend, with <a href="https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A1.24.0+label%3A%22COMP%2FOMC%2FNew+Backend%22+">14 issues</a> being fixed.</p>

<p>One <a href="https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A1.24.0+label%3ACOMP%2FOMC%2FRuntime">small fix</a> was made to the C runtime.</p>

<h4 id="graphical-editor-omedit">Graphical Editor (OMEdit)</h4>

<p>The OMEdit source code was adapted to use both Qt5 and Qt6, see pull request <a href="https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/pull/12485">#12485</a>.</p>

<p>The quality of the OMEdit GUI was further improved over the previous version 1.23.1, with about 15 issues fixed, see the
<a href="https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/issues?q=milestone%3A1.24.0+is%3Aclosed+label%3A%22COMP%2FGUI%2FInstBased+Interface%22%2CCOMP%2FGUI%2FOMEdit+">complete list</a>.</p>

<p>An important improvement regarding the usability of the GUI concerns the reaction time when editing diagrams, which used to be very slow when adding or removing components and connections in large models; these operations are now much faster, while changing parameters can still be quite slow. See <a href="https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/issues/11920">#11920</a> for more details.</p>

<p>The full 1.24.0 release notes are available <a href="https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/releases/tag/v1.24.0">here</a>.</p>

<p>The next release 1.25.0 is planned to be released in January/February 2025, with a first beta release possibly before the end of the year. It should include further improvements to the GUI such as parameter editing in hierarchically structured model, restructured Simulation Setup dialog, rename feature with refactoring, faster editing of large models, etc. Further improvements in FMI 2.0.x export are also planned.</p>

<h4 id="new-and-updated-features-in-modelon-impact">New and Updated Features in Modelon Impact</h4>

<p>We’ve been hard at work making significant enhancements to Modelon Impact. Here are a few of the product highlights from the recent <a href="https://modelon.com/blog/2024-2-release/">2024.2 release.</a></p>

<h5 id="analysis-view">Analysis View</h5>

<p>We now have a dedicated space for data visualization in Modelon Impact. While users can still configure graphs in the model view, they can now configure multiple plots and graphs simultaneously for comparative analysis.</p>

<p>Analysis View includes a histogram chart, stacked chart options, and the existing line graph and scatter plot options. All four chart options support dynamic and steady-state simulations.</p>

<p>Users can also view the results for a single simulation or a customizable set of multiple simulations. This helps users zero in on the desired results, even when performing batch simulations.</p>

<h5 id="experiment-setup">Experiment Setup</h5>

<p>Multi-run simulations in Modelon Impact just got more powerful. Users can now easily set up multiple simulations with parameter sweeps, making comparing configurations such as controller types and initialization options easier.</p>

<p>Users can also execute a Design of Experiments by specifying the number of cases they want to run and the distribution parameters.</p>

<h5 id="native-calibration-workflow">Native Calibration Workflow</h5>

<p>We’ve now built an out-of-the-box custom workflow for calibrating a model against a dataset. This calibration workflow package includes calibration examples and a customizable web application for data visualization.</p>

<p>We’ve also made significant additions to our libraries regarding Hydrogen-Powered Aircraft Applications, Improved Thermal Management Modeling, and Energy Systems Optimization.</p>

<h2 id="dymola-2025x">Dymola 2025x</h2>
<p>Dymola 2025x will be released on November 29, 2024.</p>

<h4 id="parameter-arrays">Parameter arrays</h4>
<p>Variable-length parameter arrays makes it possible to represent lookup tables in native Modleica, without the use of C code and external objects.
Parameter arrays can be initialize at simulation initialization, not translation.
Dymola allows such arrays to fix the size hen data is read. This is also supported in FMUs generated by Dymola.</p>

<h4 id="parameter-records">Parameter records</h4>
<p>Parameter records in Modelica can be created by reading a data file in SSV or CSV format.
It is also possible to let Dymola modify an existing parameter record.
Data from the file include the name of the variable, default value, unit and description.</p>

<p><img src="Dymola-2025x-record.png" alt="Parameter records"></p>

<h4 id="simulation-speed">Simulation speed</h4>
<p>Code generation for Modelica functions has been significantly improved, especially for array handing and with optimizations for constants and parameters.
Typically, this has good effect in fluid systems with many function calls for media calculations.
For example, the VaporCycle model from the <strong>ThermofluidStreams</strong> library runs more than 2x faster.</p>

<h4 id="fmi-co-simulation-technology">FMI co-simulation technology</h4>
<p>We have implemented new co-simulation technology aimed to improve performance of “heavy” FMUs with variable-step solvers.
For the right model it reduces the number of f-evaluations and Jacobian evaluations.
The fundamental idea is to smooth continuous-time Real inputs by linear interpolation during the next doStep() call.
This means the numeric integrator can continue without costly resets, leading to larger step-size and fewer evaluations.
Furthermore, a predictor compensation gives better error estimates.</p>

<h4 id="til-suite-libraries">TIL-Suite libraries</h4>
<p>The existing ThermalSystems library is replaced by TIL-Suite from TLK-Thermo.
This change will offer more complete range of libraries and extended functionality.</p>

<p><img src="Dymola-2025x-TIL.png" alt="TIL Suite"></p>

<p>It is divided into four library products at Dassault Systèmes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>TIL Base Library</li>
  <li>TIL Mobile Air Conditioning Library</li>
  <li>TIL Hydrogen Library</li>
  <li>TIL Thermal Storages Library</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a free upgrade for existing customers of ThermalSystems to TIL Mobile Air Conditioning Library.</p>

<h4 id="dymola-modelica-compiler">Dymola Modelica Compiler</h4>
<p>For toolchain integrators we now present the most minimalistic version of Dymola ever, the Dymola Modelica Compiler (DMC).
It is a command-line tool that can translate models, export FMUs, simulate and run mos-scripts.
DMC requires the usual Dymola license.</p>

<h2 id="tlk-til-suite-new-version-2024-1">TLK TIL Suite - New version 2024.1</h2>

<div style="float: right">
  <p><img src="tilsuite-logo.png" alt="tlk-tilsuite logo"></p>
</div>

<p>TIL Suite is suitable for the stationary and transient simulation of all types of thermodynamic systems. Thanks to the fast calculation of thermophysical properties (TILMedia) and many other numerical optimizations, complex thermal systems such as reversible heat pump systems can be dynamically simulated.</p>

<p>In October the <strong>TIL Suite 2024.1</strong> was released and among others, the following new features are included:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Time-variable</strong> specification, control or optimization of <strong>geometry variables</strong>, such as a heat exchanger length or diameter, in the TIL base library and Add-On Hydrogen Energy Systems</li>
  <li>Extended and <strong>improved geometry calculation</strong> for plate heat exchangers, e.g. for the specification of an asymmetrical number of channels</li>
  <li><strong>Multi-port</strong> version of the thermal models for <strong>‘heat’-resistances</strong> and <strong>-capacitances</strong> for simple graphical modeling and parameterization, e.g. for discretized applications</li>
  <li><strong>New calculation model</strong> according to ‘Mc Adams’ in VLEFluids from TILMedia for <strong>dynamic viscosity in the two-phase region</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The version prior to TIL Suite 2024.1 is 3.16.0. The versioning has been changed to only two numbers with the release year included. It is now standardized in all products of TLK-Thermo. As with the previous versions, it is possible to update your customer models automatically using the included conversion scripts.</p>

<p>For further information about TIL Suite see <a href="https://til.tlk-thermo.com">www.tlk-thermo.com</a> or contact us at <a href="mailto:til@tlk-thermo.com">til@tlk-thermo.com</a>.</p>

<h2 id="testing-library-1-8-0-reimplemented-functions-tests">Testing Library 1.8.0: Reimplemented functions tests</h2>
<p>Since the first release the Testing library supports unittests for Modelica functions.
However, this was always one of the weaker parts, as it required manual comparison of expected and actual values and setting the final test result.
Since Testing library 1.8.0 (shipped in spring with Dymola 2024x Refresh 1), test functions are much simpler to create, thanks to the new operator record <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Testing.Functions.Check</code>.</p>

<p>The code snipped below shows how the algorithm section of a modern test function for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Modelica.Math.isEqual</code> could look like:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  checks[1] := Check(
    expect = true,
    actual = isEqual(0.333, 1/3, eps=1e-3));

  checks[2] := Check(
    expect = false,
    actual = isEqual(0.333, 1/3, eps=1e-4));

  // if we expect true, we can also use the short version
  checks[3] := Check(isEqual(-0.333, -1/3, eps=1e-3));

  result := Check.summarize(checks);
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>You just have to pass the expected and the actual values to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Check</code>.
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Check.summarize</code> functions computes the overall test result from our vector of checks and prints details when a check has failed.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Check</code> has constructors for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">String</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Integer</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Boolean</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Real</code> inputs, from scalar to 3D.
Comparing vectors of strings for example works similar as above:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>checks[1] := Check(
  expect = {"angle", "force", "pressure"},
  actual = .Modelica.Utilities.Strings.sort({"force", "angle", "pressure"}));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>More information about function tests can be found in the Testing library at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Testing.Functions.UsersGuide.</code>.</p>

<h4 id="experiments-with-causality-project-hail-mary-physics">Experiments with causality (Project Hail Mary physics)</h4>

<p>Modelica does not require causality to be assigned in equations. This means that a Modelica solver, such as Dymola, must be able to solve an equation regardless of which variables are inputs and which are unknowns. To test this in Dymola an example based on flying a spaceship, as is done in the book ‘Project Hail Mary’, has been created.</p>

<h4 id="modelling-air-oil-mixtures-in-hydraulic-systems-understanding-bulk-modulus-and-the-claytex-fluid-power-approach">Modelling Air-Oil Mixtures in Hydraulic Systems: Understanding Bulk Modulus and the Claytex Fluid Power Approach</h4>

<p>In any dynamic fluid system, modelling the medium is a crucial step for achieving accurate and realistic simulations. For hydraulic system modelling, the fluid’s bulk modulus which represents the resistance of the fluid to compression, significantly affects the system’s behaviour and stiffness. Since fluid in a hydraulic system is most times under extreme pressure for system operation, it is essential to determine the correct bulk modulus and understand the factors influencing its behaviour. Temperature, pressure, and the presence of air are the main factors affecting the bulk modulus. However, in this blog post, we focus on the presence of air in oils, which significantly reduces the fluid’s bulk modulus, and discuss the modelling approach used in the Claytex FluidPower library.</p>
