<h2 id="letter-from-the-board">Letter from the Board</h2>
<p>Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP, eFMI interested,</p>

<p>the following decisions have been made at the <strong>annual Modelica Association meeting</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Modelica Association board was elected (this election takes place every two years). All previous board members were re-elected
with the following exceptions:
    <ul>
      <li>The previous FMI project leader Andreas Junghanns (Synopsys) and the FMI deputy Torsten Blochwitz (ESI Group)
resigned. We want to thank them for leading this very successful project from the beginning until the release of FMI 3.0!
The FMI group has elected Christian Bertsch (BOSCH) as the new FMI project leader and Torsten Sommer (Dassault Systèmes) as the new FMI deputy.
The Modelica Association members ratified this election.</li>
      <li>The SSP group elected Pierre Mai (PMSF) for the new SSP deputy position and the 
Modelica Association members ratified this election.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The new <a href="https://github.com/modelica/MA-Bylaws/blob/master/MA-ComplianceAndAntitrustStatement.md">Compliance and Antitrust Guidelines of the Modelica Association</a>
were accepted by the Modelica Association members.</li>
  <li>The FMI 3.0 release with its <a href="https://fmi-standard.org/docs/3.0/#fmi-whats-new">many new features</a> was released by the
FMI group and ratified by the Modelica Association members.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong><a href="https://2022.american.conference.modelica.org/">American Modelica Conference 2022</a></strong> will take place in Dallas, U.S.A., 
<strong>Oct. 26-28, 2022</strong> as a <strong>hybrid</strong> conference event.</p>

<p>The <strong><a href="https://2022.asian.conference.modelica.org/">Asian Modelica Conference 2022</a></strong> was planned as online conference
but was recently changed to a <strong>hybrid</strong> conference event. It will take place on <strong>Nov. 24-25, 2022</strong>
at Sophia University Tokyo, Japan.</p>

<p>The next <strong>International Modelica Conference</strong> will most likely take place in <strong>Aachen</strong> in <strong>Sept. or Oct. 2023</strong>.
We inform you when more details are available.</p>

<p>If you have interesting news for the Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP, eFMI communities,
please follow the <a href="https://newsletter.modelica.org/submission-guidelines.html">submission guidelines</a>.
The deadline for articles for the next newsletter is Friday, November 18, 2022.</p>

<h4 id="fmi-30-release">FMI 3.0 release</h4>

<p>The FMI 3.0 standard has been released on May 10th 2022 with many improvements and extensions compared to FMI 2.0.
For more information see the press release https://fmi-standard.org/news/2022/05/10/fmi-3.0-release.html.</p>

<h4 id="fmi-204-release-candidate-1">FMI 2.0.4 Release Candidate 1</h4>

<p>We would like to ask you for a final review of the FMI 2.0.4 Release Candidate 1.
You can find the document and a summary of changes here:  https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard/releases/tag/v2.0.4-rc.1. 
In case of findings, please open issues on https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard/issues.</p>

<p>Besides smaller fixes, this maintenance release contains two backports of FMI 3.0 features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Terminals and Icons https://fmi-standard.org/docs/3.0/#fmiTerminalsAndIcons, and</li>
  <li>Build Configuration https://fmi-standard.org/docs/3.0/#BuildConfiguration.</li>
</ul>

<p>They are “orthogonal” to the existing FMI 2.0.x features: The API and modelDescription.xml will not be touched; only two new .xml files will be added that provide new functionality for “terminals and icons” and “build configuration”. Our intention is to speed up adoption of these FMI 3.0 features by backporting them to FMI 2.0.</p>

<h4 id="new-fmi-project-leader-and-deputy">New FMI Project Leader and Deputy</h4>

<p>On May 5, 2022 the FMI Steering Committee has unanimously elected Christian Bertsch, BOSCH, as the new project leader and Torsten Sommer, Dassault Systèmes, as the new deputy.</p>

<p>The FMI Steering Committee wants to thank the outgoing project leader Andreas Junghanns, Synopsys, and deputy Torsten Blochwitz, ESI Group, for their longstanding leadership of the FMI Project and great merits to the development of the FMI standard - from the beginning until the recent release of FMI 3.0!</p>

<p><img src="https://2022.american.conference.modelica.org/images/ConferenceLogoSmall.png" alt="AMC 2020 Logo"></p>

<p>We would like to invite you to the American Modelica Conference 2022, which will take place at the University of Texas in Dallas at the <a href="https://davidson-gundy.utdallas.edu/davidson-gundy/spaces/">Davidson-Gundy Alumni Center</a> from October 26–28, 2022.  It is organized by <a href="https://namug.org/">NAMUG</a>, the North American Modelica Users Group, in cooperation with the <a href="https://modelica.org/association">Modelica Association</a>.  We are excited about this first opportunity since 2019 to meet our Modelica colleagues in person; if you are unable to attend physically, we will also provide the ability to watch streamed talks from the conference virtually for a reduced virtual conference admission fee.</p>

<p>We will present two conference tracks with presentations of peer-reviewed papers as all Modelica conferences on a wide range of topics and applications, from aerospace to robotics to power systems to building systems, as well as a track of industrial user-oriented presentations with peer-reviewed abstracts that are not accompanied by a full scientific paper.  The conference keynotes and presentations will be presented on October 26-27, and we will also host an additional set of free workshops on a range of topics on October 28.  Remaining deadlines for publications are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>September 1st, 2022: Submission of final papers and one-page abstracts</li>
  <li>October 7th, 2022: Submission of final presentations</li>
</ul>

<p>More information about the conference can be found in <a href="https://2022.american.conference.modelica.org/">this announcement</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Early bird registration</strong> is currently open <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/american-modelica-conference-2022-tickets-193515990537">on our EventBrite page</a>, and the deadline for this reduced registration fee has been extended to August 22, 2022.  This year’s Platinum Sponsor is <a href="https://software.ricardo.com/">Ricardo Software</a>, but Gold and Silver sponsorships are also still available.</p>

<h2 id="modelica-editor-s-what-s-new-since-april-2022">Modelica Editor’s What’s New - Since April 2022</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.sw.siemens.com/">Siemens Digital Industries Software</a> is proud to announce that Simcenter Amesim 2022.1 is available since April 2022, as part of its system simulation solutions. Among the key features introduced in this release, we can highlight the Modelica related improvements below.</p>

<h4 id="modelica-editor-20221">Modelica Editor 2022.1</h4>
<p>Modelica Editor is an integrated development application dedicated to editing Modelica code. More than a tool to be used during the design and modeling phase of a Modelica model, Modelica Editor allows you to generate bridges between the <strong>acausal</strong> world of Modelica and the <strong>causal</strong> environment of Amesim.</p>

<p>The improvements introduced in Modelica Editor 2022.1 are the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Modelica Compiler (Modelon’s Optimica Compiler Toolkit) upgraded to version 1.32.</li>
  <li>The Modelica Standard Library 4.0.0 in now supported, with an exception for the <strong>Clocked</strong> package.</li>
  <li>The standardized <strong>SimcenterAmesim</strong> Modelica library has been upgraded to the version 1.1, containing now the <strong>array</strong> interfaces, <strong>Thermal Hydraulic</strong> interfaces and new demos to show how to connect these two worlds via standardized physical interfaces.</li>
  <li>A new filter button in the toolbar helping the user to expose only the parameters and variables of the model top layers.</li>
  <li>Improved translation logs that now provide clearer messages with hyperlinks for easy diagnosis.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="Simcenter_Amesim_Modelica_Editor_20221.png" alt="Hybrid modelling example"></p>

<p>And thanks to the Media Properties Assistant provided in the <strong>Thermal Hydraulic</strong> Amesim Library, the media can be adjusted according to the properties described in the Modelica code, thus obtaining continuous thermodynamic properties between both worlds.</p>
