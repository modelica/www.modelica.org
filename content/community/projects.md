| Name | **MOSIM** \- Modular Simulation of Natural Human Motions |
| Web | [mosim.eu](https://www.mosim.eu/) |
| Duration | September 2018 – November 2021 |
| Budget | 10 Mill. Euro, 80 person years |
| Type of project | ITEA Project, funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) |
| Project partners | 22 partners from 4 different countries (Germany, Finland, Sweden, Austria) |
| Leader | Dr. Thomas Bär (Daimler Buses – EvoBus GmbH) |
| Purpose | The MOSIM approach helps identify conditions that negatively impact worker health & safety, or well-being, in time to eliminate or mitigate issues. To introduce software capability and solutions, that automatically simulate a rich repertoire of realistic human motions, MOSIM aims to develop and implement a generic concept inspired by the Functional Mock-up Interface standard. MOSIM extends co-simulation methodologies to the field of human simulation, by introducing Motion Model Units (MMU), to facilitate different simulation domains to share human-centric motions. |

| Name | **PHyMoS** \- Proper Hybrid Models for Smarter Vehicles |
| Web | [phymos.de](https://phymos.de/) |
| Duration | March 2021 - February 2024 |
| Budget | 4.5 Mill. Euro, 39 person years |
| Type of project | BMWi Project The project is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi). |
| Project partners | 9 German partners from industrial and research organizations, with a share of 1/3 of the funding assigned to SME. |
| Leader | Oliver Lenord (Robert Bosch GmbH) |
| Purpose | The vehicle of the future is expected to be smart. This implies a high degree of self-awareness, in other words the ability to determine and predict the state of itself and the surrounding. Creating models describing the dynamic behavior quickly and with little effort is a key competence. Classical physical models derived from first principles and data-driven models using Artificial Intelligence shall be combined to find a "Proper Model" in the sense of the best fit in terms of the trade-off between computational effort and accuracy. A framework shall be provided that allows to partially automate the hybrid method selection and model generation process based on a given set of requirements, existing physical models and data to accelerate the development of smarter vehicles and products. |

MODRIO - Model Driven Physical Systems Operation
================================================

The objective of this [ITEA2 project](https://itea3.org/) is to extend modelling and simulation tools based on open standards from system design to system operation. The major outcome will be a holistic modelling and simulation framework for physical system design, diagnosis and operation assistance.

In particular Modelica and FMI are further extended to support property/requirement modelling, state estimation, multi-mode modelling (systems with multiple operating modes and varying number of states), and nonlinear model predictive control; all functionalities based on nonlinear Modelica and/or FMI models. A major outcome will be support of these features in 10 tools.
