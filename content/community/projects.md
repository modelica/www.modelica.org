| Name | **OpenSCALING** \- Open standards for SCALable virtual engineerING and operation |
| Web | [https://openscaling.org](https://openscaling.org)  |
| Duration | November 2023 – January 2027 |
| Budget |  	10.4 Mill. Euro, 75 person years |
| Type of project | ITEA Project. The project is partially funded by the national research agencies of Germany (BMBFTR), Hungary (National Research, Development and Innovation Office), Sweden (VINNOVA).|
| Project partners | 26 partners and research organizations from Europe|
| Leader | Dr. Oliver Lenord  (Robert Bosch GmbH) |
| Purpose | The European Climate Law sets the target of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% for 2030 in Europe and to become climate-neutral by 2050. To meet these ambitious goals, open standards and established modelling and simulation tools need be enhanced to better support large-scale systems and distributed controllers optimized to minimize energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Several industrial demonstrators will showcase how the OpenSCALING innovations are applied in the energy, building, aviation, and automotive domains through green hydrogen production, more efficient heat pumps, fuel cell propulsion and electrified vehicles. |

| Name | **PHyMoS** \- Proper Hybrid Models for Smarter Vehicles |
| Web | [phymos.de](https://phymos.de/) |
| Duration | March 2021 - February 2024 |
| Budget | 4.5 Mill. Euro, 39 person years |
| Type of project | BMWi Project The project is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi). |
| Project partners | 9 German partners from industrial and research organizations, with a share of 1/3 of the funding assigned to SME. |
| Leader | Oliver Lenord (Robert Bosch GmbH) |
| Purpose | The vehicle of the future is expected to be smart. This implies a high degree of self-awareness, in other words the ability to determine and predict the state of itself and the surrounding. Creating models describing the dynamic behavior quickly and with little effort is a key competence. Classical physical models derived from first principles and data-driven models using Artificial Intelligence shall be combined to find a "Proper Model" in the sense of the best fit in terms of the trade-off between computational effort and accuracy. A framework shall be provided that allows to partially automate the hybrid method selection and model generation process based on a given set of requirements, existing physical models and data to accelerate the development of smarter vehicles and products. |

| Name | **MOSIM** \- Modular Simulation of Natural Human Motions |
| Web | [https://itea3.org/project/upsim.html](https://itea4.org/project/mosim.html) (overview at ITEA web) |
| Duration | September 2018 – November 2021 |
| Budget | 10 Mill. Euro, 80 person years |
| Type of project | ITEA Project, funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) |
| Project partners | 22 partners from 4 different countries (Germany, Finland, Sweden, Austria) |
| Leader | Dr. Thomas Bär (Daimler Buses – EvoBus GmbH) |
| Purpose | The MOSIM approach helps identify conditions that negatively impact worker health & safety, or well-being, in time to eliminate or mitigate issues. To introduce software capability and solutions, that automatically simulate a rich repertoire of realistic human motions, MOSIM aims to develop and implement a generic concept inspired by the Functional Mock-up Interface standard. MOSIM extends co-simulation methodologies to the field of human simulation, by introducing Motion Model Units (MMU), to facilitate different simulation domains to share human-centric motions. |
