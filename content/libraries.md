# Modelica Libraries

A collection of free and commercial libraries.

This page contains a list of Modelica libraries (both free and commercial).

The listed libraries are sorted by:

* Free standard conform libraries developed by the Modelica Association
* Free other libraries developed by the Modelica Association
* Free libraries provided by users of Modelica
* Free older libraries developed by the Modelica Association (deprecated)
* Commercial libraries

Note that the usage of a Modelica library requires a Modelica simulation environment, see the [tools page](/tools/).

The libraries from the Modelica Association and most free libraries can be used in commercial products according to The Modelica License.
