| ![Modelica by Application Power Systems V1.1](/images/books/1.png) | **Atiyah Elsheikh and Peter Palensky** \- ["Modelica by Application Power Systems V1.1"](https://github.com/Mathemodica/ModelicaPowerSystemBook) . An E-book illustrating the Modelica language from Power Systems perspective. However, since the e-book is following a fundamental approach, some chapters are domain indepndent and are also useful for readers not necessarily interested in power system modeling applications, e.g. Historical evolution of domain-independent system modeling principles. The e-book can be also an ideal guide for Modelica modelers seeking a better understanding of power system modeling applications. (December 2021).<br><br>Individual chapters are accessible online. Moreover, the whole e-book can be purchased for as-much-as-you-think-the-ebook-deserves.<br><br>Further details can be consulted from the following site: [https://github.com/Mathemodica/ModelicaPowerSystemBook](https://github.com/Mathemodica/ModelicaPowerSystemBook). |

The book (written in German) gives an introduction to Modelica in the field of electrical engineering with a particular focus on polyphase electric machines. Simulation examples of the open source library [HanserModelica](https://github.com/christiankral/HanserModelica) include transient and quasi stationary electric circuits including electrical systems coupled to the magnetic, thermal and mechanical domain. The theory and the implementation of the polyphase electrical machines enclosed in the Modelica Standard Library are explained in detail. Each application examples of the HanserModelica library can be simulated in OpenModelica (HanserModelica is included in [OpenModelica](https://openmodelica.org/) 1.13.0 as system library). The book also includes a brief tutorial on [GitHub](https://github.com) using [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) to explain how a Modelica project can be initiated, developed and maintained. |

| [![ModelicaByExample.png](/images/books/13.png)](https://book.xogeny.com/) | **Michael Tiller** \- ["Modelica by Example"](https://mbe.modelica.university/) (May 2014). Michael Tiller's latest book on Modelica is the result of a Kickstarter project whose goal was to produce a freely accessible book on Modelica. Now, anyone who wants to learn Modelica can access a free, online and interactive version of the book at [https://mbe.modelica.university/](https://mbe.modelica.university/).<br><br>The book starts off with a discussions on modeling various types of behavior in Modelica (equations, discrete events, differential equations). This is followed by a step-by-step explanation of how to create reusable component models, subsystems and architectures that encapsulated the mathematical behavior. Along the way, various Modelica features like arrays and functions are also introduced. |
| [![Book Cover - PraxisDerSimulationstechnik.jpg](/images/books/14.jpg)](https://www.peter-junglas.de/fh/publications/simulation/index.html) | **Peter Junglas** \- ["Praxis der Simulationstechnik"](https://www.peter-junglas.de/fh/publications/simulation/index.html) (January 2014). This book (written in German) gives a thorough introduction to simulation using a lot of practical examples. The second part ("Object oriented methods") describes Modelica and its libraries using MapleSim and OpenModelica as tools. For more information please have a look at [the publisher's site](https://www.europa-lehrmittel.de/titel-481-481/praxis_der_simulationstechnik-1803/) and the [the author's site](https://www.peter-junglas.de/fh/publications/simulation/index.html). |
| [Modelica Web Reference](https://webref.modelica.university/) | **Michael Tiller** \- ["Modelica Web Reference"](https://webref.modelica.university/) (2013). While this is not technically a "book" on Modelica, it a useful online reference for information about the Modelica language. Many examples and explanations are accessible within a single click and it includes links back to the specification when further detail is required. This web reference is constantly evolving and the source material is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/modelica-university/webref). |
| [![Book Cover - Peter Fritzson 2.jpg](/images/books/15.jpg)](https://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-111801068X.html) | **Peter Fritzson** \- The new short introductory book ["Introduction to Modeling and Simulation of Technical and Physical Systems"](https://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-111801068X.html) (September 2011) by Peter Fritzson is aimed at teaching Modelica modeling and simulation to beginners, or in courses where there is only limited time for an introduction to Modelica. However, if you already have the big book "Principles of Object-Oriented Modeling and Simulation with Modelica 2.1", you will not need the new book, except for teaching introductory courses. The book is 232 pages, uses downloadable exercises and solution, and uses the Modelica language standard version 3.1. |
| [![Book Cover - Peter Beater.jpg](/images/books/16.jpg)](https://books.google.com/books?id=eX-eyw2eb3IC) | **Peter Beater** \- ["Regelungstechnik und Simulationstechnik mit Scilab und Modelica"](https://books.google.com/books?id=eX-eyw2eb3IC) (January 2010). This book (written in German) gives an introduction to two aspects of the design of technical systems: Analytical analysis and control of their stability and non-linear simulation of their behaviour in the time domain. The first part of the book covers the standard methods of classical control and thus gives a foundation to understand modern simulation tools. In the second part several technical examples are used to explain modelling and simulation approaches. They start with a simple linear electrical oscillator, followed by a non-linear pendulum, a bouncing ball, heat conduction in a long rod and a pneumatic bellows. These examples are first used to introduce simple numerical integration algorithms and their pitfalls and later to explain basic concepts and operators in Modelica. The most important Modelica keywords and operators are listed and explained in a separate chapter.<br><br>The book is intended for students and engineers of mechanical engineering. Especially in the first part, there are numerous examples and problems to illustrate the theory. An appendix gives a summary of the required mathematical methods and physical models and answers to the problems. |
| [![Book Cover - Peter Fritzson.jpg](/images/books/17.jpg)](https://www.ida.liu.se/labs/pelab/modelica/OpenModelica/Documents/ModelicaBookExcerpts.pdf) | **Peter Fritzson** \- ["Principles of Object-Oriented Modeling and Simulation with Modelica 2.1"](http://books.google.com/books?id=IzqY8Abz1rAC) (November 2003). This book teaches modeling and simulation and gives an introduction as well as a very comprenhensive overview of the Modelica language including many examples. Moreover, about one third of the book is devoted to application examples and related application background theory. Many of these examples are available in downloadable executable form from the OpenModelica.org web site. Part four of the book gives an overview of the most important symbolic and numeric methods used in typical Modelica tools. Appendices include parts of the Modelica standard library. The whole book is 940 pages long.  [Book excerpts.](http://www.ida.liu.se/labs/pelab/modelica/OpenModelica/Documents/ModelicaBookExcerpts.pdf) [More...](http://www.mathcore.com/drmodelica) |
| [![Book Cover - Micheal Tiller.jpg](/images/books/18.jpg)](https://amzn.to/ModelicaBook) | **Michael Tiller** wrote the first book on Modelica with the title ["Introduction to Physical Modeling with Modelica"](https://amzn.to/ModelicaBook) (May 2001). The book provides a solid foundation in the Modelica modeling language and shows interesting modeling examples from a wide range of engineering disciplines.
