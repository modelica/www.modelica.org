    description="Michael Tiller's latest online book on Modelica is the result of a Kickstarter project whose goal was to produce a freely accessible book on Modelica. The book starts off with a discussions on modeling various types of behavior in Modelica (equations, discrete events, differential equations). This is followed by a step-by-step explanation of how to create reusable component models, subsystems and architectures that encapsulated the mathematical behavior. Along the way, various Modelica features like arrays and functions are also introduced."

    description="This book offers an introduction to the development and simulation of Modelica models for engineering applications. The target audience are bachelor’s or master’s level students, interested in modeling and simulation, and with a background in both physics and numerical methods. The book is structured into three parts. The modeling methodology and the Modelica features for continuous-time modeling are discussed in the first part of the book. The simulation of continuous-time Modelica models is addressed in the second part of the book. The third part of the book is devoted to discuss hybrid modeling and simulation in Modelica. The modeling methodology, the Modelica language features, and the use of modeling environments are explained by means of examples."

    description="This exercise book provides an introduction to the simulation practice in Engineering using Modelica. To this end, it contains a series of thirteen independent hands-on assignments of increasing complexity. Each assignment contains the description of a system and a mathematical model of the system’s behavior. The proposed task often consists in describing this mathematical model in the Modelica language and simulate it. In some assignments, the system’s behavior is described as an atomic model, without internal structure. Some other assignments ask to design and implement a model library, and to compose the system model by instantiating and connecting components from this model library."

    name="Thinking in Systems, Not Code" 
    author="Ankit Anurag Naik"
    year="2026"
    link="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Not-Code-Understand/dp/915318176X/"
    image="/images/books/Naik2026.png"
    description="Thinking in Systems, Not Code: Using Modelica to Model and Understand Complex Systems presents Modelica as more than a programming language—it introduces a system-level way of thinking about modeling and simulation. Rather than focusing on syntax, the book explains how complex systems are framed through structure, boundaries, and physical relationships, and how behavior emerges from interacting components. Using examples from energy systems, electric vehicles, thermal and fluid systems, and system dynamics with stocks, flows, and feedback loops, it shows how equation-based, acausal modeling enables reusable, scalable, and domain-independent models. The book is suitable both for engineers new to Modelica who want to understand the underlying modeling philosophy, and for experienced users interested in a deeper perspective on model structure, abstraction, and how modern Modelica tools transform equations into executable simulations."

    year="2018"
    link="https://a.co/d/6M1EoIP"
    image="/images/books/Coic2019.png"
    description="The development of mechatronic and multidomain technological systems requires the dynamic behavior to be simulated before detailed CAD geometry is available. This book presents the fundamental concepts of multiphysics modeling with lumped parameters. The approach adopted in this book, based on examples, is to start from the physical concepts, move on to the models and their numerical implementation, and finish with their analysis. With this practical problem-solving approach, the reader will gain a deep understanding of multiphysics modeling of mechatronic or technological systems – mixing mechanical power transmissions, electrical circuits, heat transfer devices and electromechanical or fluid power actuators. Most of the book's examples are made using Modelica platforms..."

    description="Cet ouvrage présente les concepts fondamentaux de modélisation multiphysique à paramètres localisés. Cette approche permet de modéliser des systèmes technologiques multidomaines de type mécatronique et donne la possibilité de simuler le comportement de systèmes avant que la géométrie CAO détaillée ne soit disponible. Elle est implémentée aujourd'hui par de nombreux logiciels : Simscape (Matlab), AMEsim, VHDL-AMS, Dymola (Modelica), OpenModelica (Modelica), etc. L'approche adoptée est de partir des concepts physiques pour aller ensuite vers les modèles et leur implémentation numérique et finir par leur analyse et leur utilisation en conception. Modélisation multiphysique des systèmes technologiques expose via des exemples pratiques les principaux concepts menant à la mise en place et à l'utilisation de modèles stationnaires et transitoires à paramètres localisés. La plupart de ces exemples sont réalisés à l'aide du langage Modelica..."

    image="/images/books/Beater2010.png"
    description="This book (written in German) gives an introduction to two aspects of the design of technical systems: Analytical analysis and control of their stability and non-linear simulation of their behavior in the time domain. The first part of the book covers the standard methods of classical control and thus gives a foundation to understand modern simulation tools. In the second part several technical examples are used to explain modelling and simulation approaches. They start with a simple linear electrical oscillator, followed by a non-linear pendulum, a bouncing ball, heat conduction in a long rod and a pneumatic bellows. These examples are first used to introduce simple numerical integration algorithms and their pitfalls and later to explain basic concepts and operators in Modelica. The most important Modelica keywords and operators are listed and explained in a separate chapter. The book is intended for students and engineers of mechanical engineering."

    image="/images/books/Elsheikh2021.png"
    description="An E-book illustrating the Modelica language from Power Systems perspective. However, since the e-book is following a fundamental approach, some chapters are domain independent and are also useful for readers not necessarily interested in power system modeling applications, e.g. Historical evolution of domain-independent system modeling principles. The e-book can be also an ideal guide for Modelica modelers seeking a better understanding of power system modeling applications.&nbsp;Individual chapters are accessible online. Optionally, the whole e-book can be purchased for as-much-as-you-think-the-ebook-deserves."
