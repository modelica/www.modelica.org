<!-- Note on updated name since 2025-->
The Modelica Association publishes its confereces proceedings in a journal.
Until 2024, the name of the proceedings and journal was "Modelica Conference Proceedings". Due to the increased adoptiona and importance of the FMI stnadard by the Modelica Association, the name of the proceedings and journal is "Modelica and FMI Conference Proceedings". Since its inception in 2000 the papers from the Modelica Conference Proceedings have collected over 5000 citations. 

## Aim & Scope
The International Modelica & FMI Conference explores the frontier of science and technology to model and simulate complex physical and cyber-physical systems for a wide range of research and industrial applications. In particular, the conference covers topics such as symbolic algorithms and numerical methods to simulate equation-based, object-oriented models for design optimization, real-time simulation, and model-based control, as well as model-based system development methods and tools, modeling language design and semantics, and model library design. It also covers applications in automotive, aircraft, space, robotics, energy systems, and other areas using the modeling language Modelica and other Modelica Association standards for system simulation such as FMI, SSP, DCP, and eFMI.

## Peer Review Process

The proceedings of the Modelica Conference collect the scientific papers of the Modelica Conference series. In order to appear as part of this conference series each paper has to undergo a peer review process with at least 3 independent reviews.

The reviewers must have no conflict of interest with the authors of the reviewed paper. A conflict of interest between a reviewer and a paper exists if:
- the reviewer is author of the paper or acknowledged as contributing source.
- the reviewer works for the same organization as one of the authors.
- the reviewer has co-authored a paper with any of the papers authors in the last 24 months.

Presentation material and slides are not subject to a peer-review process and may only be appended to the proceedings. 

## Journal Ownership and Management

## Governing Body

[//]: # (needs written rules about how we do with mix of MA and local organizers conference board.)

The Modelica Conferences are conducted by a local organizer in cooperation with the Modelica Association. The details of this cooperation are stipulated by a corresponding license agreement.

For each Modelica conference, a conference board is established. The conference board takes on the organizational duties of its specific conference and also serves editorial duties. To ensure alignment with the editorial policies of the Modelica conference proceedings at least 4 members of the Editorial board must be members of the conference board. Futhermore, the complete editorial board is given access to all the reviews and the conference boards decisions in order to conduct oversight. This access is unrestricted. The editorial board is given the power to overrule any editorial decisions of the conference board with a simple majority and quorum of five
