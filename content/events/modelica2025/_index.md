## Call for Industrial User Presentations

You are encouraged to submit an  **extended abstract**  of 1-2 pages, related to one of the existing or possibly new  [Modelica Association Projects](https://modelica.org/community/projects/):

- LANG - Modelica Language
- LIB - Modelica Libraries
- FMI - Functional Mock-up Interface 
- eFMI - Functional Mock-up Interface for embedded systems
- SSP - System Structure and Parameterization of Components for Virtual System Design
- DCP - Distributed Co-Simulation Protocol

Please submit your abstract using the [EasyChair Conference Management System](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=16imoc) by **June 1st, 2025**. Please note, this link only works properly if you 1) Have an account on Easychair and 2) are logged into the account when you click the link.

Industrial user presentations are an excellent way to present recent results to the Modelica community with less effort and overhead than a full paper submission. Please indicate whether you plan to give your presentation on-site or remotely in the submission form. These industrial user presentations differ from paper presentations, which we expect to be in-person. These abstracts will be peer-reviewed by experts, but no corresponding papers will be published in the conference proceedings.

Please note that purely tool-related presentations are not permitted for these application-oriented presentations, and should instead be covered by vendor presentations. For more details on vendor presentations, please refer to the [call for sponsors](../callforsponsors25).

## Call for Libraries

You are encouraged to submit a free Modelica application library in Modelica source code form. The library should be sent to the program chair ([modelica25@modelica.org ](mailto:modelica25@modelica.org)) and provided under the [3-clause BSD License for the Modelica Association](https://modelica.org/licenses/modelica-3-clause-bsd). Please submit also a corresponding paper to the conference. If the paper gets accepted, you can present your library at the conference. Awards will be given to the best libraries. The exact number of awards and the amounts are still to be determined.

Libraries are evaluated according to the following criteria:

- How useful is the library for the Modelica community, especially for industrial applications?
- Basic design principle of the library (e.g. physical components are modeled in a declarative way and there are no un-physical restrictions how components can be connected together).
- Completeness and extent of the library (small or large library, examples).
- Usage of the library (component documentation, users guide, parameter menus, etc.)
- Accepted libraries will be included on the conference stick and linked from the Modelica web site.

## Keynote Speakers 

We are proud to announce our keynote speakers: 

Tuesday, September 9th:

| {{< figure  src="/images/ETH-BIB-Mishra_Siddhartha.jpg" alt="Mishra_Siddhartha" width="400px" >}}  |**Mishra Siddhartha,** Professor and Deputy Head of the Seminar for Applied Mathematics at ETH Zürich|
| **Physics-Informed AI** | AI is increasingly being used in the fast and accurate simulation of physical systems. In this keynote, we will discuss how knowledge of the underlying physics can be explicitly incorporated into AI systems for physical simulations. Key examples will highlight the potential gains as well as the involved challenges.| 


 Wednesday, September 10th:

| **Opportunities and Challenges in Design and Operation of Integrated Energy Systems** | The complexity of modern integrated energy systems demands the systematic use of systems engineering methods and tools to address key challenges across product lifecycle. This keynote will explore three related and critical areas: 1) the demand for diverse model fidelities and analysis, 2) maintaining consistency across design layers, and 3) the importance of seamless tooling and integration. Real-world, HVAC-specific examples will highlight how these challenges are being tackled in practice and the opportunities they present. For over two decades, Carrier has relied on Modelica as a cornerstone technology for model-based product design. The journey began with the development of control systems for transportation refrigeration, where transient simulations allowed for rapid control function development and verification. Today, while controls development remains a vital application, Carrier has expanded Modelica's use across the entire product lifecycle—from conceptual design, through testing and verification, to business sales tools, and into operation with monitoring and diagnostics. Design and operation of highly integrated energy systems such as data centers and district heating systems also calls for new methods and tools. Differentiated applications has driven diversified analysis with Modelica models. Modelica-based steady-state simulation has emerged as a back-bone in product design, sales tools, as well as in field diagnostics. Steady-state and transient optimization is also a necessary element across the product life cycle. The need for diversified analysis and computation is further amplified by application of systems engineering methods where requirements, design space exploration, and validation and verification are key elements. |

The conference will take place at the [Rotkreuz campus](https://dock.hslu.ch/rundgang/index.html?startscene=i)  of Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, which can be reached in as little as 13 minutes by train from Lucerne railroad station. We recommend taking the train to the campus, as the campus is located directly at Rotkreuz station. The university cannot provide parking spaces in Rotkreuz. There are parking spaces in the vicinity of the campus whose availability and prices are not subject to the university. 

Under the following link, conference participants will find a **[limited contingent of hotels in Lucerne and Rotkreuz at discounted rates.](https://regis.buchertravel.ch/event/International_Modelica_Conference2025)** Please use the search window to view all available hotels and prices. We would like to point out that Lucerne offers significantly more tourist attractions than Rotkreuz. However, Lucerne is in high season during the conference, so accommodation costs may be higher. Cheaper alternatives can be found, for example, in youth hostels in the city of Lucerne, Airbnbs, or hotels in the vicinity of Lucerne and Rotkreuz with good rail connections.

## Scope of the Conference

[Modelica](/) is a freely available, equation-based, object-oriented language for convenient and efficient modeling of complex, multi-domain cyber-physical systems described by ordinary differential, difference and algebraic equations. The Modelica language and the companion Modelica Standard Library have been utilized in a variety of demanding industrial applications, including full vehicle dynamics, power systems, robotics, buildings and district energy systems, hardware-in-the-loop simulations and embedded control systems. The [Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)](https://www.fmi-standard.org/) is an open standard for the tool-independent exchange of models and for co-simulation. It is supported by many [Modelica and non-Modelica tools](/tools/) and is the key to utilizing Modelica models in non-Modelica environments.

Development in the Modelica Association is organized in [Modelica Association Projects](/association/#modelica-association-projects):

- LANG - Modelica Language
- LIB - Modelica Libraries
- FMI - Functional Mock-up Interface
- eFMI - Functional Mock-up Interface for embedded systems
- SSP - System Structure and Parameterization of Components for Virtual System Design
- DCP - Distributed Co-Simulation Protocol

These projects collaborate to design and maintain a set of coordinated standards for modeling and simulation of complex physical systems.

The Modelica & FMI conference will bring together people using Modelica and/or other Modelica Association standards for modeling, simulation, and control applications, such as Modelica language designers, tool vendors and library developers. The Modelica Conference provides Modelica users with the opportunity to stay informed about the latest language, library, and tool developments, and to get in touch with people working on similar modeling problems. The conference will cover topics such as the following:

- Multi-engineering modeling and simulation with free or commercial Modelica libraries 
- Library Award for new Open-Source Modelica Libraries. 
- Applications and new tool developments for the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) and Layered Standards (LS)
