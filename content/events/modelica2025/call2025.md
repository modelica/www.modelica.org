## Call for Industrial User Presentations

You are encouraged to submit an  **extended abstract**  of 1-2 pages, related to one of the existing or possibly new  [Modelica Association Projects](https://modelica.org/community/projects/):

-   LANG - Modelica Language
-   LIB - Modelica Libraries
-   FMI - Functional Mock-up Interface 
-   eFMI - Functional Mock-up Interface for embedded systems
-   SSP - System Structure and Parameterization of Components for Virtual System Design
-   DCP - Distributed Co-Simulation Protocol


<!-- The extended abstract in PDF or MS Word format of about 500 words should be submitted through the  [EasyChair Conference Management System](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=16imoc) before **June 1st, 2025*. Please note this link only works properly if you 1) Have an account on [Easychair](https://www.easychair.org) and 2) are logged into the account when you click the link.  -->

An extended abstract of approximately 500 words, in PDF or MS Word format, will need to be submitted through the EasyChair Conference Management System by **June 1st, 2025**. A submission link will be provided in this section once available, along with detailed instructions. Industrial user presentations are an excellent way to present recent results to the Modelica community with less effort and overhead than a full paper submission. Please indicate whether you plan to give your presentation on-site or remotely in the submission form. These industrial user presentations differ from paper presentations, which we expect to be in-person. 

These abstracts will be peer-reviewed by experts, but no corresponding papers will be published in the conference proceedings.

Please note that purely tool-related presentations are not permitted for these application-oriented presentations, and should instead be covered by **vendor presentations**.


## Call for Tutorials


At the Modelica conference, several tutorials will take place in parallel. Each tutorial will last for up to 4 hours and includes a "hands-on-experience" session (participants are expected to have own notebook; the presenter will provide the presented tools). <!-- If you are interested, please use the application form for  [Workshops and Tutorials](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScsRLAe-YwK7yAQoW6B5KQQ87M_SU4dgj6eKnvpjG3h53HMGw/viewform) --> An application form for Workshops and Tutorials will be made available here in due course.
The deadline for application is  **June 1st, 2025**; however, as only a limited number of tutorials can be held in parallel, we advise you to apply as early as possible.

<!-- Tutorials are free for the participants, but especially for commercial tools the presenter is charged $250 per session, provided it is a hands on training tutorial, not just commercial presentation or demonstration (for product presentations see Vendor sessions above). Upon written request some tutorials, especially non-commercial, (e.g. FMI, Open Source libraries etc.), could be exempted from the fee by decision of the organising committee. -->

Decision about the acceptance of tutorials will be based upon Modelica/FMI relation of content and on the time of application.

Payment of fees will be handled through our registration links via EasyChair (not available yet).


<!-- The authors of the 10% top papers submitted to the conference will be invited to submit an extended version after the conference, for inclusion in a special issue of an open-access, ISI-referenced journal. Please note that the extended papers will undergo a full peer-review process which is independent from the one of the Modelica Conference. -->


<!-- ## Student Best Paper Competition

 The 2023 American Modelica Conference is pleased to announce the Student Best Paper Award. First-listed authors of regular or invited papers who were students at the time of submission are eligible. The academic advisor must write a nomination letter (maximum of 1 page) describing the contribution of the nominee to the paper and to the state of the art. The nomination letter should also confirm that the first author is a registered student at the time of submission. Note that only a single lead author of a paper can be nominated; if two students on the same paper are nominated, both nominations will be disqualified.

To complete the nomination form, please enter the corresponding information on [EasyChair](https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=namugamc2024) after submitting the paper. The nominations should be entered by August 30, 2024.
