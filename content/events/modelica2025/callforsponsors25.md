## Call for Sponsors
<!-- 
Please let us inform you about the opportunity to present yourself as sponsor and exhibitor of the next Modelica conference for Modelica and FMI as well as related standards.

##  On the upcoming conference -->

The 16th International Conference will be the first in Switzerland, which hosts a very interesting market for modeling and simulation tools. In recent years, the Swiss economy has re-focused on its production and engineering sector, which is highly specialized and export-oriented. Whereas many European states shrank their industrial production in the last decade, Switzerland maintained [healthy growth](https://www.focus-economics.com/country-indicator/switzerland/industry/) in this important metric. Its economy is one of the [freest world-wide](https://www.heritage.org/index/pages/country-pages/switzerland), and almost 99% of all enterprises represent SMEs, reflecting the specialized nature of its industry. Classic system modeling and simulation have now become increasingly important for many of these SMEs. 

We are very glad that the Lucerne School of Engineering and Architecture took the initiative and provides us with a formidable venue right in the heart of Switzerland at the [Campus-Rotkreuz](https://www.hslu.ch/en/lucerne-school-of-information-technology/campus/). The venue is very well suited for exhibitors, since the exhibition rooms are aligned with the natural commute of the conference participants. Modelica conferences always had a healthy mixture of academia and industry among its participants. To further foster industry participation, we plan dedicated Industrial user sessions free of academic hurdles. 

## Sponsoring Options

We offer exhibition and sponsoring in 4 different options (prices without 8.1%-VAT).

| Option | Price CHF | No. of free registrations |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Platinum | 12500 | 3 - each with a value of 900 CHF |
| Gold | 10000 | 2 - each with a value of 900 CHF| 
| Silver | 5000 | 1 - with a value of 900 CHF| 
| Bronze | 3000 | 0 | 

<!-- - Platin:	12.500,00 CHF (includes 3 free registrations)
- Gold:	12.500,00 CHF (includes 2 free registrations)
- Silver:	5.000,00 CHF (includes 1 free registrations)
- Bronze:	3.000,00 CHF  -->

The number of spaces available for each option is limited. The exhibition spaces range from 8 to 20 m². Higher-level sponsors may choose their exhibition space first in order to secure a larger stand area. Depending on the option, the logos of the sponsoring partners will be positioned more prominently on the conference website and in the conference program. The [virtual 3D tour](https://dock.hslu.ch/rundgang/index.html?startscene=i) will give you a comprehensive impression of the venue. 

<!-- The exhibition area is located in a transit and recreation zone to ensure high visibility. Sponsorship of the conference is also possible without an exhibition area.    -->

We hope to have sparked your interest and are looking forward to a personal conversation to discuss the best sponsorship option for your organization. It would be our pleasure to welcome you as a partner at the 16th International Modelica Conference.

<!-- Places in each category are limited. High tiers earn the right to choose the location of their booth first and a larger booth space. Also, the presentation of the logos on the conference web page and in the conference program will be more prominent for high tiers. Attached you find a floor plan [Campus-Rotkreuz](https://www.hslu.ch/en/lucerne-school-of-information-technology/campus/) and a [virtual 3D tour](https://dock.hslu.ch/rundgang/index.html?startscene=i). This may help you get a first impression of the venue. -->
