## Call for Sponsors

Please let us inform you about the opportunity to present yourself as sponsor and exhibitor of the next Modelica conference for Modelica and FMI as well as related standards.

##  On the upcoming conference

The 2025 International conference will be held Lucerne, Switzerland. This is the first visit of our conference to Switzerland, which hosts a very interesting market for modeling and simulation tools. 

In recent years the Swiss economy re-focussed on its production and engineering sector that is highly specialized and export-oriented. Whereas many European states shrank their industrial production in the last decade, Switzerland maintained a [healthy growth](https://www.focus-economics.com/country-indicator/switzerland/industry/) in this important metric. Its economy is one of the [freest world-wide](https://www.heritage.org/index/pages/country-pages/switzerland) and almost 99% of all enterprises represent SMEs, reflecting the specialized nature of its industry. Classic system modeling and simulation now becomes increasingly important for many of these SMEs. 

We are very glad that the Lucerne School of Engineering and Architecture took the initiative and provides us with a formidable venue right in the heart of Switzerland. The venue is very well suited for exhibitors, since the exhibition rooms are aligned with the natural commute of the conference participants. 

Modelica conferences always had a healthy mixture of academia and industry among its participants. To further foster industry participation, we plan dedicated Industrial user sessions free of academic hurdles.
