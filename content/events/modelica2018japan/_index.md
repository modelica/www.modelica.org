The **Second Japanese Modelica Conference** will be held in Tokyo, Japan on **May 17-18, 2018**. It is organized by ANSYS, Inc. in cooperation with [Modelica Association](/association/).

The Modelica Conference is the main event for users, library developers, tool vendors and researchers to share their knowledge and learn about the latest scientific and industrial progress related to Modelica and to the [Functional Mockup Interface](http://www.fmi-standard.org/) (FMI).
The program will cover modeling of complex physical and cyber-physical systems, as well as tools, for a wide range of research and industrial applications. All contributions are peer-reviewed and selected by the Program Committee.

Scope of the Conference
-----------------------

Modelica is a freely available, equation-based, object-oriented language for convenient and efficient modeling of complex, multi-domain cyber-physical systems described by ordinary differential, difference and algebraic equations. The companion Modelica Standard Library has been utilized in demanding industrial applications, including full vehicle dynamics, power systems, robotics, hardware-in-the-loop simulations and embedded control systems.

The [Functional Mockup Interface (FMI)](http://www.fmi-standard.org/) is a freely available standard for the tool-independent exchange of models and for co-simulation. It is supported by many Modelica and non-Modelica tools and is the key to utilize Modelica models in non-Modelica environments.

The Modelica conference will bring together people using Modelica and/or FMI for modeling, simulation, and control applications, Modelica language designers, Modelica and/or FMI tool vendors and Modelica library developers. It provides Modelica users the opportunity to stay informed about the latest language, library, and tool developments, and to get in touch with people working on similar modeling problems. Expected topics include but are not limited to:

* Multi-engineering modeling and simulation with free and commercial Modelica libraries (mechanics, electrical, hydraulics, thermal fluid, media, chemical, building, automotive, aircraft, etc.) 
* Automotive applications
* Thermodynamic and energy systems applications
* Mechatronics and robotics applications
* Medicine and biology applications
* Other industrial applications, such as electric drives, power systems, aerospace, etc.
* Large-scale system modelling
* Real-time and hardware-in-the-loop simulation
* Simulation and code generation for embedded control systems
*  Simulation acceleration by use of many CPU cores or GPU cores
* Applications of Modelica for optimization and optimal control
* Modelica modeling, simulation and design tools
* Symbolic algorithms and numerical methods for model transformation and simulation
* Discrete modeling techniques − FEM, CFD, DEM (Discrete Element Method), etc.
* New features of the Modelica language and of FMI
* Experimental language designs and implementations related to Modelica
* Modelica in other application areas (mathematical programming, databases, etc.)
* Modelica for teaching and education
* FMI in Modelica and non-Modelica applications and tools

In addition, the conference will include a Modelica vendor exhibition.
