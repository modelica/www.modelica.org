## Aim & Scope

The **International Modelica and FMI Conference series** explores the frontier of science and technology to model and simulate complex physical and cyber-physical systems for a wide range of research and industrial applications. It is the largest and main impacting event for application specialists, developers of model libraries and simulation software, as well as language designers of the [equation based modeling language Modelica](https://www.modelica.org/) and related technology such as the [Functional Mockup Interface](https://fmi-standard.org/) (to exchange or co-simulate dynamic models). In particular, the conference covers topics such as symbolic algorithms and numerical methods to simulate equation-based, object-oriented models for design optimization, real-time simulation, and model-based control, in automotive, aircraft, space, robotic, energy systems and other areas.

## Rules and Governing Body

The Modelica and FMI Conference is organized by the Modelica Association and a local organizer. The local organizer is selected by the members of the Modelica Association. The Modelica Association has 50% ownership for the financial responsibilities. A steering committee from the Modelica Association (see below) supervises the conference organization and guarantees the high scientific level of the conference.

For each Modelica conference, a conference board is established. The conference board takes on the organizational duties of its specific conference and also serves editorial duties.

To ensure alignment with the editorial policies of the Modelica conference proceedings at least 4 members of the Editorial board must be members of the conference board. Furthermore, the complete editorial board is given access to all the reviews and the conference boards decisions in order to conduct oversight. This access is unrestricted. The editorial board (listed below) is given the power to overrule any editorial decisions of the conference board with a simple majority and quorum of five.

The proceedings are published electronically with open access in the series [Linköping Electronic Conference Proceedings](https://ecp.ep.liu.se/index.php/modelica/issue/archive) (ISSN: 1650-3686, eISSN: 1650-3740).

The local organizers of a Modelica conference must follow the [Instructions for conference organizers](https://ecp.ep.liu.se/index.php/index/publish).
 


## Peer Review Process

Only full papers can be submitted: Required are 4-10 pages with double columns according to provided templates. In exceptional cases, the Editorial Board can extend the maximum page limit to 14 pages, in case the authors provide a justification.

The proceedings of the Modelica Conference collect the scientific papers of the Modelica Conference series. In order to appear as part of this conference series each paper has to undergo a peer review process with at least 3 independent reviews.

The reviewers must have no conflict of interest with the authors of the reviewed paper. A conflict of interest between a reviewer and a paper exists if:
- the reviewer is author of the paper or acknowledged as contributing source.
- the reviewer works for the same organization as one of the authors.
- the reviewer has co-authored a paper with any of the papers authors in the last 24 months.

Presentation material and slides are not subject to a peer-review process and may only be appended to the proceedings.


## Ethics 

The [Publishing Ethics and Malpractice Statement](https://journal.ep.liu.se/index.php/index/ethics) of this series is the fundamental code of conduct for a Modelica Conference.

## Author Rights and Fees

The authors of the papers keep their copyright and all rights on their paper and give the Modelica Association and Linköping University Electronic Press just the right for publishing.

To be accepted for publication in the conference proceedings, the paper must have succesfully undergone the peer review process and must have been presented by a registered participant at the corresponding conference. 

Authors are not required to pay any fees for submitting or publishing their papers in the Modelica and FMI Conference Proceedings. The Modelica Association covers all publication costs to ensure that the proceedings are available as gold open access. This policy reflects the Association's commitment to supporting the dissemination of knowledge without financial barriers.
