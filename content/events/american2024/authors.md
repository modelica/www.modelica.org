# Authors' guide

## Submission process

Information about the submission process is following soon.

## Preparation of full papers and Extended Abstracts for Industrial User Presentations

The template has been updated for the 2021 conference, so do not use older versions of the template.
Please use the [LaTeX template](https://github.com/modelica-association/conference-templates/tree/master/LaTeX) for the creation of full papers.
There is a [Word template](https://github.com/modelica-association/conference-templates/tree/master/MSWord) that is based on the LaTeX template.
The Word template contains some wording specific to LaTeX packages; when drafting a document in Word, please make the contents look similar to what the LaTeX templates produce.
For draft paper submissions, you may also use other templates (but include an extra page at the end stating you will use the correct template for the final submission).

Please make sure that your submission has been created according to the [Modelica Formatting Guidelines](https://modelica.org/events/american2024/formatting/).

For the final submission, there will also be the possibility to submit Modelica example model files that correspond to your publication. These files will then be attached to your paper in the Modelica Association copy of the proceedings (but not the LiU e-press copy that the DOI points to).

## Preparation of Industrial User Presentations. 

There are no specific templates for industrial user presentations. The presentations follow the same guidelines as for full papers 

## Technical equipment for presentations

Papers must be presented during the conference in person. Papers that are not presented will be retracted. All presentations are 20 minutes long with an additional 5 minutes for questions.

## Poster Session

Some papers are invited to present their paper with a poster instead of a presentation. These papers still need to submit a full paper. Additionally, a poster is presented at the conference. The poster is going to be placed at the beginning of the conference and will be present throughout the full conference duration. Furthermore, dedicated times are defined, where the authors should be next to their posters to allow for questions and answers and encourage discussion
Please prepare and bring a DIN A0 Poster. There is no poster template. Please design the poster in a way that best suits the content of your paper.
