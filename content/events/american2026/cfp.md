## CALL FOR PAPERS 

American Modelica & FMI Conference **2026 - October 12-14, 2026**  - Submission Deadline **May 1, 2026**

The Modelica and FMI Conference is the main event for users, library developers, tool vendors and language designers to share their knowledge and learn about the latest scientific and industrial progress related to Modelica, FMI, SSP, eFMI and DCP. The program will cover processes and tools for the modeling of complex physical and cyber-physical systems as applied to a wide range of research and industrial applications. 

We invite you to participate in the 2026 American Modelica & FMI Conference, to be held in Atlanta, GA at the Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory. The event will feature both technical presentations of peer-reviewed papers and industrial user presentations without a paper that focus on application aspects interesting to the community. 

For the 2026 conference we will include a new track on the structure and application of equation-oriented modeling languages other than Modelica into the program, since we see many similarities that will enrich a conversation centered on principles of equation-oriented modeling.  We invite users of these other modeling languages to submit their technical publications to this conference. We hope that the broader scope will benefit the growth of equation-oriented modeling.  

For scientific presentations, you are encouraged to submit a full paper until May 1, 2026. Every submitted paper will be reviewed by at least 3 reviewers. If you would like to submit an industrial user group presentation, you are encouraged to submit an abstract only (no paper submission) until June 1, 2026.

Prospective authors of scientific presentations are encouraged to submit a full paper of at least 4 pages, with a maximum of 10 pages, on the following topics:

 *	Multi-engineering modeling and simulation with Modelica or other equation-oriented modeling languages (mechanics, electrical, hydraulics, thermal, fluid, media, chemical, building, automotive, aircraft, …)
 *	Automotive applications
 *	Thermodynamic and energy systems applications
 *	Mechatronics and robotics applications
 *	Medicine and biology applications
 *	Other industrial applications, such as electric drives, power systems, aerospace, etc.
 *	Large-scale system modelling
 *	Real-time and hardware-in-the-loop simulation
 *	Simulation and code generation for embedded control systems
 *	Simulation acceleration by use of many CPU cores or GPU cores
 *	Applications of modeling techniques for optimization and optimal control
 *	Modeling, simulation and design tools
 *	Symbolic algorithms and numerical methods for model transformation and simulation
 *	Discrete modeling techniques − FEM, CFD, DEM (Discrete Element Method), …
 *	New features of the Modelica language and of FMI
 *	Experimental language designs and implementations
 *	Use of languages for teaching and education
 *	FMI applications and tools
 *	Applications and tools related to Modelica Association standards, including FMI, eFMI, SSP, and DCP
 
The papers presented will be published by LiU Electronic Press and be available at no cost to interested readers. 

## Call for Industrial User Presentations

You are encouraged to submit an  **extended abstract**  of 1-2 pages, related to one of the existing or possibly new  [Modelica Association Projects](https://modelica.org/projects):

-   LANG - Modelica Language
-   LIB - Modelica Libraries
-   FMI - Functional Mockup Interface
-   eFMI - Functional Mockup Interface for embedded systems
-   SSP - System Structure and Parameterization of Components for Virtual System Design
-   DCP - Distributed Co-Simulation Protocol


The extended abstract in PDF or MS Word format of about 500 words should be submitted through the  [EasyChair Conference Management System](https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=namugamc2026) before **June 1st, 2024**. Please note this link only works properly if you 1) Have an account on [Easychair](https://www.easychair.org) and 2) are logged into the account when you click the link. Industrial user presentations are an excellent way to present recent results to the Modelica community with less effort and overhead than a full paper submission. Please indicate whether you plan to give your presentation on-site or remotely in the submission form. These industrial user presentations differ from paper presentations, which we expect to be in-person. 

These abstracts will be peer-reviewed by experts, but no corresponding papers will be published in the conference proceedings.

Please note that purely tool-related presentations are not permitted for these application-oriented presentations, 
and should instead be covered by **vendor presentations**, which are reserved for sponsors.

## Call for Tutorials


At the Modelica conference, several tutorials will take place in parallel. Each tutorial will last for up to 4 hours and includes a "hands-on-experience" session (participants are expected to have own notebook; the presenter will provide the presented tools). If you are interested, please use the application form for  [Workshops and Tutorials](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScsRLAe-YwK7yAQoW6B5KQQ87M_SU4dgj6eKnvpjG3h53HMGw/viewform).  The deadline for application is  **June 1st, 2024**; however, as only a limited number of tutorials can be held in parallel, we advise you to apply as early as possible.

Tutorials are free for the participants, but especially for commercial tools the presenter is charged $250 per session, provided it is a hands on training tutorial, 
not just commercial presentation or demonstration (for product presentations see Vendor sessions above). 
Upon written request some tutorials, especially non-commercial, (e.g. FMI, Open Source libraries etc.), could be exempted from the fee by decision of the organising committee. 

Decision about the acceptance of tutorials will be based upon Modelica/FMI relation of content and on the time of application.

Payment of fees will be handled through our registration links via Eventbrite.

<!-- The authors of the 10% top papers submitted to the conference will be invited to submit an extended version after the conference, for inclusion in a special issue of an open-access, ISI-referenced journal. Please note that the extended papers will undergo a full peer-review process which is independent from the one of the Modelica Conference. -->


## Student Best Paper Competition

 The 2023 American Modelica Conference is pleased to announce the Student Best Paper Award. First-listed authors of regular or invited papers who were students at the time of submission are eligible. The academic advisor must write a nomination letter (maximum of 1 page) describing the contribution of the nominee to the paper and to the state of the art. The nomination letter should also confirm that the first author is a registered student at the time of submission. Note that only a single lead author of a paper can be nominated; if two students on the same paper are nominated, both nominations will be disqualified.
