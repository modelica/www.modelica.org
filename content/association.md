## Our Mission

The Modelica Association is a non-profit, non-governmental organization with the aim  of **developing and promoting open and coordinated standards for system modelling and simulation.**

In concrete terms, our current work can be summarized by two main branches:

- Development and specification of the open Modelica language as well as the development and refinement of corresponding modeling Libraries, most essentially the Modelica Standard Library.
- The development and distribution of collaborative industrial standards for modeling and simulation such as FMI, eFMI, SSP, and DCP.

A more detailed account of our work is provided by the list of Modelica Association Projects below.

Furthermore, the Modelica Association owns and administrates incorporeal rights related to Modelica, including but not limited to trademarks, the Modelica Language Specification, Modelica Standard Libraries, etc., which should be generally available for the promotion of industrial development and research.

## Join the Modelica Association

If you share our goals and would like to contribute, you can become a member of the Modelica Association in two ways. You can become

- an individual member or
- an organizational member, representing your company.

Membership gives you voting rights and enables you to participate in the discussions and technical work of the Association.
It is encouraged to join at least one of the MA projects as a guest before becoming a member.  

If you are interested, simply contact the [Modelica board](mailto:board@modelica.org) and explain your motivation.
The [individual application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1AKymk2UfwDSJR4fuYXAyGJuvPw7YLiBFF76jqLSjzWM/edit) provides useful guidance.

## History of the Modelica Association

There have been several attempts to define object-oriented languages for physical modeling. However, the ability to reuse and exchange models relies on a standardized format. It was thus important to bring this expertise together to unify concepts and notations.
The Modelica design effort was initiated by Hilding Elmqvist, Dynasim AB, and started in September 1996 within an action of the ESPRIT project "Simulation in Europe Basic Research Working Group (SiE-WG)".
The Modelica language has been designed by the developers of the object-oriented modeling languages Allan, Dymola, NMF, ObjectMath, Omola, SIDOPS+, Smile and a number of modeling practitioners in different domains.
After 8 three-day meetings, during a 1-year period, a first version of a Modelica language description was put on the web in September 1997.
After 19 three-day meetings, during a 3-year period, version 1.3 of the language specification was finished in December 1999.
This was the first version used in actual applications. In December 2000 an update of the language, version 1.4, has been published.
